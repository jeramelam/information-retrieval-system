<CENTER><H1><I> June 1996:  RRB Issuing Statements of Service </I></H1></CENTER>
<HR>
<H3><STRONG>

  Each year, the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board issues a "Certificate of Service
Months and Compensation" (Form BA-6) for every railroad employee who received
creditable railroad compensation in the previous calendar year.  These annual
statements provide employees with a record of their railroad retirement service 
and compensation credits in the preceding year, as well as their cumulative 
credits. 
<BR><BR>  Most employees will receive Form BA-6 directly from the Board by mail during 
the latter half of June, although some forms are distributed through employers.  
Employees who worked for a railroad in 1995, but have not received a Form BA-6 
by mid-July, or need a replacement, should contact the nearest <A href="field.html">Board field 
office.</A>
<BR><BR>  It is important that employees review their BA-6 form to see whether their 
own records of service months and creditable compensation agree with the figures 
shown on the form.  In checking the 1995 compensation total, employees should 
be aware that only annual earnings up to $61,200 were creditable for railroad 
retirement purposes in that year, and that $61,200 is the maximum amount shown 
on the form.  To assist employees in reviewing their service credits, the form 
also shows service credited on a month-by-month basis for 1994, 1993 and 1992, 
when the creditable compensation maximums were $60,600, $57,600 and $55,500, 
respectively.  In addition, the form identifies the rail employers reporting 
the employee's 1995 service and compensation.
<BR><BR>  Besides the months of service reported by rail employers, Form BA-6 shows 
the number of any additional service months deemed by the Board.  Deemed service
months may be credited under certain conditions for an employee who did not work 
in all 12 months of the year, but had earnings exceeding monthly prorations of 
the creditable tier II earnings maximum for the year.  However, the total of 
reported and deemed service months may never exceed 12 in a calendar year, and 
no service months, reported or deemed, can be credited after retirement, 
severance, resignation, discharge, or death.  In addition to regular compensation 
which generally yields service month credits, the form shows miscellaneous 
compensation, such as taxable sickness payments or some other payments to former 
employees which provide additional earnings credits but do not provide additional 
service month credits.
<BR><BR>  The BA-6 form also shows the cumulative amount of tier II railroad retirement 
payroll taxes paid by the employee over and above tier I social security 
equivalent payroll taxes.  The Board computes this amount in order to advise 
employees, after their retirement, of these payroll tax contributions for
Federal income tax purposes.
<BR><BR>  For former employees who received separation or severance payments, the form, 
in the section designated "Taxable Amount," shows the amount of any separation 
allowance or severance payments in the last four years that was subject to 
railroad retirement payroll taxes but did not provide additional tier II service 
credits.  This information is shown on the form because in these circumstances 
a lump sum, approximating part or all of the tier II taxes deducted from such 
payments made after 1984, may be payable by the Board upon retirement to 
employees with 10 years of service, or to survivors if the employee dies before 
retirement.  The amount of an allowance included in an employee's regular
compensation is shown under "Compensation Amount."
<BR><BR>  An employee who receives Form BA-6 with an incorrect name, address, date of 
birth or social security number can have the information corrected by contacting 
the nearest <A href="field.html">Board field office.</A>  If there is a name difference, an employee 
should be aware that the form may not show his or her full surname if the 
surname exceeds 10 letters, "Junior" or "Senior" was used with the surname, or 
the employee first worked for a railroad in 1995.  Employees may also contact 
a Board field office to request a detailed breakdown, by year, of all railroad 
service and compensation credited to them.  For most employees, the address 
and phone number of the Board office serving the employee's area is provided 
on the form.
<BR><BR>  Any other discrepancies in Form BA-6 should be reported promptly in writing 
to the: 
<BR>Chief of Compensation and Certification
<BR>Office of Programs
<BR>U.S. Railroad Retirement Board
<BR>844 North Rush Street
<BR>Chicago, Illinois 60611-2092.  
<BR><BR>The employee must include his or her social security number in the letter.  
The reverse side of the Form BA-6 explains what other documentation and 
information should be provided.  The law limits to four years the period 
during which corrections can be made.

<H2><STRONG>
The Railroad Retirement Board frequently receives questions from
railroad employers and employees and their legal advisors about the
Board's treatment for railroad retirement purposes of pay for time 
lost.  The most common type of pay for time lost arises out of personal
injury settlements.  Other types include dismissal allowances
and guaranteed wages; allowances paid for loss of earnings resulting
from the employee being placed in a position or occupation paying less
money; and reinstatement awards which include back pay.
<BR><BR>
It is important that agreements between employers and employees
involving pay for time lost are structured correctly for railroad
retirement purposes because they are often intended to provide an
employee with additional months of creditable service needed to
qualify for railroad retirement benefits.  The following questions and
answers describe the requirements for the railroad retirement crediting
of pay for time lost.

1. How do the railroad retirement laws treat "pay for time lost"?
</I></STRONG></H1>
<H2><STRONG>
Pay for time lost attributable to lost earnings for an identifiable
period of absence from active service is treated as compensation
creditable under the Railroad Retirement and Unemployment Insurance
Acts.  Since the intent of an award for pay for time lost is to treat
the employee as if he or she had actually performed compensated
service during that period of time, the effect upon railroad retirement
eligibility and benefits is identical to the effect of regular
earnings for which service and compensation credit is received.

<H1><STRONG><I><A NAME ="2">
2. What factors should be taken into account to ensure that payment
for time lost will be creditable for railroad retirement purposes?
</I></STRONG></H1>
<H2><STRONG>
A payment must be made with respect to an identifiable period of time.
The months of the period of absence from active service must be
specified, for example "the 12 month period beginning September 1994 
and ending August 1995."  In the case of a payment for personal 
injury, the entire amount is considered pay for time lost unless, at
the time of payment, the employer states that a particular amount of
the payment was for other reasons.  The compensation is considered
earned in, and therefore creditable to, the specified period.
<BR><BR>
An employment relationship must exist in the months to be credited
with pay for time lost.  Allocation toward future months is permissible
as long as an employment relation is retained for that period.  If
a settlement agreement requires that an employee resign to receive the
payment, the employment relation ceases upon resignation. Allocation
after the resignation date is not allowed because it cannot be considered
time lost as an employee.  With respect to pay for time lost
allocated into the future, service months and compensation are not
creditable until the time lost has actually elapsed.
<BR><BR>
The allocation must also relate to the actual period of absence from
service for which payment is made.  Pay for time lost due to personal
injury may not be allocated to service months missing from an employee's
record before the date of injury.  Similarly, the amount of the 
pay for time lost must relate to an employee's normal monthly pay.  A 
monthly allocation of at least ten times the employee's daily pay rate 
in effect on the date of injury is ordinarily considered a reasonable
relationship to actual lost wages.  A lesser amount would be considered
a token payment and would not be acceptable.
</STRONG></H2>
<H4><img border=0 src="bloostar.gif" alt="*"><A href="#inside"><I>Return to Index</A></I></H4>
<HR><BR><P>

<H1><STRONG><I><A NAME ="3">
3. What other factors should be considered to ensure that a payment
for time lost correctly provides the total of railroad retirement
service months intended?
</I></STRONG></H1>
<H2><STRONG>
It is of primary importance to have a precise breakdown of an employee's
service prior to any allocation.  This will avoid allocating pay 
for time lost to a month or months already reported as service months.
Occasionally, an employee will have service months reported for
vacation pay, or by another railroad employer, for example, by reason
of paid union activity.  Credit can only be received once for any
given month.  Because the period specified is the period for which
service credit is due, a month allocated to the same month already on
record may result in a shortage of the total months desired.
<BR><BR>
In addition, deemed service months shown on Form BA-6, Certificate of
Service Months and Compensation, should not be considered in the
number of total service months when an allocation period is determined
if those deemed service months are within the allocation period.  A
pay for time lost allocation increasing service and compensation will
generally eliminate or reduce the number of deemed service months on
record for any affected year.  Deemed service months are the product
of a calculation and if the components of that calculation change as
the result of an adjustment to service and compensation due to a
payment for time lost, then the number of deemed service months to
which an employee is entitled is likely to change.
<BR><BR>
Also, the possibility that an employee has creditable military service
should be considered because such military service is not reflected on
Form BA-6 and may reduce the number of allocated months needed to
attain annuity eligibility.

4. Is pay for time lost subject to railroad retirement tier I and
tier II payroll taxes?
</I></STRONG></H1>
<H2><STRONG>
The Railroad Retirement Tax Act is administered by the Internal
Revenue Service, and only the IRS can provide definitive advice
concerning that Act.  However, it is the Board's understanding that 
the IRS considers pay for time lost as compensation subject to taxation
under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act at the tier I and tier II
tax rates and annual maximum earnings bases in effect when payment is
made.  Pay for time lost is not, however, creditable on the basis of
when the payment is made, but to the period for which the payment is
allocated.  Therefore, the taxable amount and creditable amount will
sometimes differ.  The employee's portion of the railroad retirement 
tax liability is usually withheld from the gross amount of the award.

5. What effect would pay for time lost have on the payment of a
railroad retirement annuity or unemployment or sickness benefits for
the same days?
</I></STRONG></H1>
<H2><STRONG>
Because pay for time lost is considered earned in the month allocated,
an employee is not entitled to an annuity under the Railroad Retirement
Act with respect to any months to which pay for time lost has
been allocated.  If an employee applies for retirement benefits at the
expiration of an allocation period, he or she should submit documentation
of the period covered by the agreement with the application.
<BR><BR>
Similarly, an employee is not entitled to unemployment or sickness
benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act with respect to
any months to which pay for time lost has been allocated.  If a
payment for time lost is made which covers a period for which benefits
under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act were previously paid,
the benefits would be subject to recovery.
<BR><BR>
For more information on the treatment of pay for time lost for railroad
retirement purposes, contact the Railroad Retirement Board's 
Bureau of Research and Employment Accounts at 844 North Rush Street,
Chicago, Illinois 60611-2092.

<h3>
CALIFORNIA LAW
</h3>
California Law, including the 29 subject area Codes, the Constitution and the Statutes, is updated as new laws are enacted.  These laws can be displayed or searched.
<p>
<b>To display the Table of Contents for a Code,</b>  select the Code and click on Search.   From within the Table of Contents, you may select a range of sections  to display by clicking on the underlined section numbers.
<p>
<b>To search by keyword(s),</b> select one Code, several Codes, or ALL for all Codes, enter the keyword(s) in the box provided, and click on Search.  Searching on multiple keywords will retrieve documents containing all of the entered keywords. 
<p>
When documents are returned after a search has completed, the order in which the documents appear on the screen is based on what is known as relevance ranking.  Each document is scored based on its relevance to a user's
question, where the most relevant document has the highest
score, or rank -- 1000 being the highest, 1 being the
lowest.  Documents are returned to the screen in order of the document with the highest score listed first and the document receiving the lowest score appearing last.  
<p>
A document receives a higher score if the words in
the question are in the headline, if the words appear many
times, or if phrases occur as they do in the question. A
document's score is derived using techniques such as word
weighting, term weighting, proximity relationships, and word
density. 

<p>
Each of the documents retrieved will be underlined and will consist of the name of the Code along with the range of sections corresponding to the groupings made in the Table of Contents.  The word(s) specified in the search will be found within these section code ranges and will be highlighted.  All code sections within the range will be displayed by clicking on the underlined code.

<h3>DETAILED TIPS ABOUT SEARCHING</h3>


<h4>Special Search Note</h4>
Words so common that they occur in almost every document are called
<a href="stopwords.html">stop words.</a>  These stop words cannot be used for
searching a document because they occur so frequently that 
they are not useful for distinguishing one document from another.
Stop words are <strong>ignored</strong> during a search.  If they are
inadvertently used for a search, the results may be undesirable.
<p>
<h4>Natural Language Search</h4>
The server can be queried using natural language questions.
The server does not understand the question, rather it takes
the words and phrases in the question and finds documents
that have those words and phrases in them. "Tell me about
portable computers." is an example of a natural language
question.  In this example, the WAIS server would search for
documents containing the words 'portable' and 'computers';
the other words, 'tell', 'me', and 'about', are called "stop
words" -- words so common that they occur in almost every
document and so they are not used for searching a document.
<p>
<h4>Literal Strings</h4>
A similar but more specific kind of query asks to find
documents that contain one or more exact phrases by
enclosing them in double quotation marks. This is known as a
literal. For example, the query<p>
<pre>  <strong>"search engine capabilities"</strong></pre><p>
returns only documents that contain this exact phrase.
The WAIS search engine performs a literal search exactly as
if you had used the boolean operator ADJ. Thus the above
example would yield the same results as<p>
<pre>  <strong>search ADJ engine ADJ capabilities</strong></pre><p>
For this reason, it is best to stick to noun phrases when
using literals; if your literal phrase includes stopwords,
the stopwords will be ignored.
<p>

<h4>Boolean Operators</h4>
The boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ aid in
establishing logical relationships between concepts
expressed in natural language. These operators are
especially useful in narrowing down the search.<p>
<strong>AND, &amp;&amp;</strong><p>
     The AND operator is helpful in restricting a search
     when a particular pair or larger group of terms is
     known. For instance, when searching for documents on
     the weather in Boston, a question such as "weather AND
     Boston" would return only those documents that contain
     both the word "weather" and the word "Boston". You can
     use more than one AND in a query, e.g.  "weather AND
     Boston AND November". Note that the C-like double
     ampersand (&amp;&amp;) may be used instead of spelling out the
     word AND.
<p>     
<strong>OR, ||</strong><p>
     The OR operator is often used to join two different
     phrases of a Boolean search. A question such as
     "hurricane OR tornado" would search for all documents
     containing either the word "hurricane", or the word
     "tornado", or both. You can also use more than one OR
     in a query.  A natural language question is much like
     having an implicit OR between the words, except that
     the search engine does more work in a natural language
     query to determine the relevance of words and their
     relationships in a phrase.  Note that the C-like double
     vertical bars (||) may be used instead of spelling out
     the word OR.
<p>     
<strong>NOT</strong><p>
    NOT is a binary operator. That is, it has to come
     between two or more words or parenthesized clauses. NOT
     is used to reject any documents that contain certain
     words. The question "basketball NOT college" would find
     all documents containing the word "basketball", that do
     not also contain the word "college".  Note, however,
     that this question would eliminate articles on any
     professional players that mention their alma maters; in
     other words, be careful not to limit your search too
     much with the NOT operator, make sure that you know
     what you're throwing away.
<p>     
Don't be afraid to use NOT!  One good search strategy is to
search for a broadly occurring term and get lots of
documents you don't want, and then to use NOT to filter out
the bad documents.  For example, if you're trying to cook
okra, you might search for "cooking AND okra" and find
nothing; but if you search for "cooking", you find lots of
articles on cooking meats and pastas.  You then can search
for "cooking NOT meat NOT pasta", and you might find more
interesting articles that eventually lead you to your goal.
Another handy trick is to use NOT to "break the 40 barrier".
Typical WAIS clients only display 40 documents, but if you
use NOT wisely, you can flush out the documents you don't
like in those 40 and progressively refine your search,
adding better and better documents to the 40 that you see.<p>
<strong>ADJ</strong><p>
    The adjacent operator, ADJ, is used to ensure that one
     word is followed by another in the returned document,
     with no other words in between. For example, "cordless
     ADJ telephone" returns only documents containing
     "cordless telephone" and ignores documents that only
     contain one of the words or that contain both but not
     adjacent to one another. ADJ will nonetheless work when
     stopwords interrupt two words; for example, the
     preceding example will find occurrences of "cordless
     for telephone". Note that the ADJ operator yields the
     same results as does a literal query. Also note that
     ADJ, unlike AND, OR, and NOT, is not a commutative
     property - "telephone ADJ cordless" does not work the
     same as "cordless ADJ telephone".
     
<p>
<h4>Mixing Natural Language, Literals, And Booleans</h4>
The ability to mix natural language, literals, and boolean
operators is unique to the WAISserver search engine.
Combining natural language and boolean operators enables end
users to better target their searches. For example, suppose
you were looking for documents specifically on portable
laptop computers that are not made by Tosuji Corporation.
The question could then be "Tell me about portable laptop
computers NOT Tosuji."
<p>
<h4>Fielded Search</h4>
For data sets whose documents have special data fields,
selected portions of the documents can be tagged by the WAIS
parser as fields. A client can then ask a WAIS server to
limit its search to those documents containing a user-
specified value of a particular field. This is called a
fielded search.<p>
The mail-or-rmail parse format is an example of a parse
format in which fields are tagged. For this parse format,
the WAIS parser detects the "to" and "cc" fields, the "from"
and "sender" fields, the "subject" field, and the "date"
field. An example of a question using natural language, a
boolean operator, and fielded search is: "company picnic AND
from=barbara". The WAIS server would then find email
messages about a company picnic that Barbara sent.
<p>
<h4>Date and Numeric Ranges</h4>
For a date or numeric field, a range may be specified using
the syntax<p>
<pre>  <strong>field-name    comparison-operator    value</strong></pre><p>
where comparison-operator may be one of &gt; (greater than),
&lt; (less than), &gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less than
or equal to), or = (equal to).<p>
Currently, dates with the following formats are supported:<p>
<pre>             <strong> m-d-yy    m-d-yyyy    mm-dd-yy
              m/d/yy    mm/dd/yy    m.d.yy
              today     yesterday</strong></pre><p>
Only positive integers are supported for numeric fields.
If the comparison operator is =, then the range may be
specified using the word TO, as in<p>
<pre>           <strong>date = 4/15/93 TO 4/14/94</strong></pre><p>
Both ends of the range are inclusively specified.
<p>
<h4>Right Truncation (Wildcards)</h4>
A user can specify right truncation by ending a word with
the asterisk (*) wild card character.  This tells the search
engine to search on words whose first several characters
match the base characters before the *.  For example, you
might use right truncation in a question such as geo*, which
may retrieve documents containing the words: geographer,
geography, geologist, geometry, geometrical, etc.
<p>
<h4>Grouping Search Terms</h4>
A user can group search terms and phrases together using
parentheses.<p>
For example, if you wish to search for information about
snowstorms, tornadoes, or hurricanes in New York City, you
might search for "(snowstorms OR tornadoes OR hurricanes)
AND (New ADJ York ADJ City)." You can also nest your
parentheses; for example, "from = ( (ben ADJ wais) OR
(brewster ADJ think) )" searches for messages from either
ben@wais.com or brewster@think.com.  When you're using
several boolean operators, you should always group, to
disambiguate how the operators are to be applied.
<p>
<h4>Special Characters</h4>
The WAIS server was originally designed to be as general as
possible and, in this spirit, it ignores all characters in a
document that are not either an alphabetical letter or a
number.  In fact, non-alphanumeric characters usually
separate words for the parser, for example, "F.Y.I." parses
out to three words.  This rule also applies to queries used
to search a directory of servers.

lowest.  Documents are returned to the screen in order of the document with the highest score listed first and the document receiving the lowest score appearing last.  
<p>
A document receives a higher score if the words in
the question are in the headline, if the words appear many
times, or if phrases occur as they do in the question. A
document's score is derived using techniques such as word
weighting, term weighting, proximity relationships, and word
density.

<h3>DETAILED TIPS ABOUT SEARCHING</h3>


<h4>Special Search Note</h4>
Words so common that they occur in almost every document are called
<a href="stopwords.html">stop words.</a>  These stop words cannot be used for
searching a document because they occur so frequently that 
they are not useful for distinguishing one document from another.
Stop words are <strong>ignored</strong> during a search.  If they are
inadvertently used for a search, the results may be undesirable.
<p>
<h4>Natural Language Search</h4>
The server can be queried using natural language questions.
The server does not understand the question, rather it takes
the words and phrases in the question and finds documents
that have those words and phrases in them. "Tell me about
portable computers." is an example of a natural language
question.  In this example, the WAIS server would search for
documents containing the words 'portable' and 'computers';
the other words, 'tell', 'me', and 'about', are called "stop
words" -- words so common that they occur in almost every
document and so they are not used for searching a document.
<p>
<h4>Literal Strings</h4>
A similar but more specific kind of query asks to find
documents that contain one or more exact phrases by
enclosing them in double quotation marks. This is known as a
literal. For example, the query<p>
<pre>  <strong>"search engine capabilities"</strong></pre><p>
returns only documents that contain this exact phrase.
The WAIS search engine performs a literal search exactly as
if you had used the boolean operator ADJ. Thus the above
example would yield the same results as<p>
<pre>  <strong>search ADJ engine ADJ capabilities</strong></pre><p>
For this reason, it is best to stick to noun phrases when
using literals; if your literal phrase includes stopwords,
the stopwords will be ignored.
<p>

<h4>Boolean Operators</h4>
The boolean operators, AND, OR, NOT, and ADJ aid in
establishing logical relationships between concepts
expressed in natural language. These operators are
especially useful in narrowing down the search.<p>
<strong>AND, &amp;&amp;</strong><p>
     The AND operator is helpful in restricting a search
     when a particular pair or larger group of terms is
     known. For instance, when searching for documents on
     the weather in Boston, a question such as "weather AND
     Boston" would return only those documents that contain
     both the word "weather" and the word "Boston". You can
     use more than one AND in a query, e.g.  "weather AND
     Boston AND November". Note that the C-like double
     ampersand (&amp;&amp;) may be used instead of spelling out the
     word AND.
<p>     
<strong>OR, ||</strong><p>
  The OR operator is often used to join two different
     phrases of a Boolean search. A question such as
     "hurricane OR tornado" would search for all documents
     containing either the word "hurricane", or the word
     "tornado", or both. You can also use more than one OR
     in a query.  A natural language question is much like
     having an implicit OR between the words, except that
     the search engine does more work in a natural language
     query to determine the relevance of words and their
     relationships in a phrase.  Note that the C-like double
     vertical bars (||) may be used instead of spelling out
     the word OR.
<p>     
<strong>NOT</strong><p>
  NOT is a binary operator. That is, it has to come
     between two or more words or parenthesized clauses. NOT
     is used to reject any documents that contain certain
     words. The question "basketball NOT college" would find
     all documents containing the word "basketball", that do
     not also contain the word "college".  Note, however,
     that this question would eliminate articles on any
     professional players that mention their alma maters; in
     other words, be careful not to limit your search too
     much with the NOT operator, make sure that you know
     what you're throwing away.
<p>     
Don't be afraid to use NOT!  One good search strategy is to
search for a broadly occurring term and get lots of
documents you don't want, and then to use NOT to filter out
the bad documents.  For example, if you're trying to cook
okra, you might search for "cooking AND okra" and find
nothing; but if you search for "cooking", you find lots of
articles on cooking meats and pastas.  You then can search
for "cooking NOT meat NOT pasta", and you might find more
interesting articles that eventually lead you to your goal.
Another handy trick is to use NOT to "break the 40 barrier".
Typical WAIS clients only display 40 documents, but if you
use NOT wisely, you can flush out the documents you don't
like in those 40 and progressively refine your search,
adding better and better documents to the 40 that you see.<p>
<strong>ADJ</strong><p>
The adjacent operator, ADJ, is used to ensure that one
     word is followed by another in the returned document,
     with no other words in between. For example, "cordless
     ADJ telephone" returns only documents containing
     "cordless telephone" and ignores documents that only
     contain one of the words or that contain both but not
     adjacent to one another. ADJ will nonetheless work when
     stopwords interrupt two words; for example, the
     preceding example will find occurrences of "cordless
     for telephone". Note that the ADJ operator yields the
     same results as does a literal query. Also note that
     ADJ, unlike AND, OR, and NOT, is not a commutative
     property - "telephone ADJ cordless" does not work the
     same as "cordless ADJ telephone".
     
<p>
<h4>Mixing Natural Language, Literals, And Booleans</h4>
The ability to mix natural language, literals, and boolean
operators is unique to the WAISserver search engine.
Combining natural language and boolean operators enables end
users to better target their searches. For example, suppose
you were looking for documents specifically on portable
laptop computers that are not made by Tosuji Corporation.
The question could then be "Tell me about portable laptop
computers NOT Tosuji."
<p>
<h4>Fielded Search</h4>
For data sets whose documents have special data fields,
selected portions of the documents can be tagged by the WAIS
parser as fields. A client can then ask a WAIS server to
limit its search to those documents containing a user-
specified value of a particular field. This is called a
fielded search.<p>
The mail-or-rmail parse format is an example of a parse
format in which fields are tagged. For this parse format,
the WAIS parser detects the "to" and "cc" fields, the "from"
and "sender" fields, the "subject" field, and the "date"
field. An example of a question using natural language, a
boolean operator, and fielded search is: "company picnic AND
from=barbara". The WAIS server would then find email
messages about a company picnic that Barbara sent.
<p>
<h4>Date and Numeric Ranges</h4>
For a date or numeric field, a range may be specified using
the syntax<p>
<pre>  <strong>field-name    comparison-operator    value</strong></pre><p>
where comparison-operator may be one of &gt; (greater than),
&lt; (less than), &gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less than
or equal to), or = (equal to).<p>
Currently, dates with the following formats are supported:<p>
<pre>             <strong> m-d-yy    m-d-yyyy    mm-dd-yy
              m/d/yy    mm/dd/yy    m.d.yy
              today     yesterday</strong></pre><p>
Only positive integers are supported for numeric fields.
If the comparison operator is =, then the range may be
specified using the word TO, as in<p>
<pre>           <strong>date = 4/15/93 TO 4/14/94</strong></pre><p>
Both ends of the range are inclusively specified.
<p>
<h4>Right Truncation (Wildcards)</h4>
A user can specify right truncation by ending a word with
the asterisk (*) wild card character.  This tells the search
engine to search on words whose first several characters
match the base characters before the *.  For example, you
might use right truncation in a question such as geo*, which
may retrieve documents containing the words: geographer,
geography, geologist, geometry, geometrical, etc.
<p>
<h4>Grouping Search Terms</h4>
A user can group search terms and phrases together using
parentheses.<p>
For example, if you wish to search for information about
snowstorms, tornadoes, or hurricanes in New York City, you
might search for "(snowstorms OR tornadoes OR hurricanes)
AND (New ADJ York ADJ City)." You can also nest your
parentheses; for example, "from = ( (ben ADJ wais) OR
(brewster ADJ think) )" searches for messages from either
ben@wais.com or brewster@think.com.  When you're using
several boolean operators, you should always group, to
disambiguate how the operators are to be applied.
<p>
<p>
<h4>Special Characters</h4>
The WAIS server was originally designed to be as general as
possible and, in this spirit, it ignores all characters in a
document that are not either an alphabetical letter or a
number.  In fact, non-alphanumeric characters usually
separate words for the parser, for example, "F.Y.I." parses
out to three words.  This rule also applies to queries used
to search a directory of servers.

<h3>
STATUTES
</h3>
Statutes, chaptered bills, are available starting from January, 1993.    
<br>
<br>
<b>If you know the chapter number and year,</b> enter the number and year in the boxes provided, and click on Search.
<br>
<br>
<b>If you do not know the chapter year,</b> enter the chapter number in the box  provided.  The system will retrieve all the chapters with that number beginning with 1993.  
<br>
<br>
<b>If you do not know the chapter number,</b> but know the bill number, go to the Bill Information page and request it by the Assembly or Senate bill number.  The final version of the Assembly or Senate  bill which has passed through both Houses and been signed by the Governor will contain the Chapter number.
<br>
<br>
<b>To search Statutes by keyword(s),</b> enter the keyword(s), and click on Search.  Searching on multiple keywords will retrieve documents containing all of the entered keywords.

When documents are returned after a search has completed, the order in which the documents appear on the screen is based on what is known as relevance ranking.  Each document is scored based on its relevance to a user's
question, where the most relevant document has the highest
score, or rank -- 1000 being the highest, 1 being the
lowest.  Documents are returned to the screen in order of the document with the highest score listed first and the document receiving the lowest score appearing last.  
<p>
A document receives a higher score if the words in
the question are in the headline, if the words appear many
times, or if phrases occur as they do in the question. A
document's score is derived using techniques such as word
weighting, term weighting, proximity relationships, and word
density.

<H2 ALIGN=center>"Acupuncture by silver skewers of rain the earth
revivifies..."<BR>
poet Cecil Rajendra</H2>

God has such a weird sense of humor. For the past few years I have been quoting flippantly Peter Drucker's aphorism that the future belongs to three different kids of people: those who are crazy, crooked, and quick change artists. These past few months God has decided it was time for me to give the aphorism my personal due regarding, dues-paying acknowledgment.<P>

"Into everyone's life some rain must fall." How many sermons have I preached on what it means to live rain-lashed lives? How many times have I lectured in painstaking and (I confess) pain-inducing detail that every one of us will not get out of life without experiences of suffering, failure, disability, and death? How often have I argued that everyone of us needs personal "disasters" to make us, and to make us the person God intends us to be?<P>

<CENTER><B>
"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of
comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and
controversy."<BR>
Martin Luther King, Jr.<P>
</B></CENTER>

My favourite illustration of this has been the Chevy Chase remake of the classic movie The Invisible Man. Chase becomes invisible after an industrial accident. Henceforth he could only be seen when outlined by rain, powdered concrete, or something that fell on him . It's the same way in life. You don't really know the values or value of a person until the rain falls, or a bag of powdered concrete falls on one's head.<P>

But the song says that "some rain must fall" in everyone's life. "Some rain" is different from tornadoes of quick change, hailstorms of crookedness and hurricanes of craziness, in that order. After eleven wonderful years at United Theological Seminary (UTS), my decision to accept the invitation to become dean of the Theological School at one of the church's great universities, Drew University (starting 1 September), brought with it a rush of the brain, a tug at the heart and a know in the stomach that hasn't gone away. The joy and excitement of this 'quick change" in my life was quickly mixed with the news of the bankruptcy of the "Christian" foundation New Era, in which UTS (along with 300+ other charities) had venture capital monies invested. This New Era shock to the moral nervous system-which proved Drucker prophetic about the persistence of that old era "sin," and made those of us in development realize how much snake oil is actually out there-added to the knot and the tug a feeling like vomiting but without the ability to actually bring anything up (there are some authors that leave me feeling this way as well-thy shall go nameless).<P>

My mother used to tell me and my brothers,"Boys, God never wastes an experience." It is still too early to tell what the experiences of these past two months will lead to.<P>

Already they have led me back to basics, to the meaning of an ensouled life to the rediscovery of the sheer joy of living and to engage in the spiritual exercise of assembling my own personal list of "These are a Few of My Favorite Things."<P>

The Russian poet Joseph Brodsky, who was a Nobel laureate in this 40's, ended his poem on his 40th birthday like this:<P>

<CENTER><B>
"Yet until brown clay has been crammed down my larynx, only gratitude
will be gushing from it."<BR>
Joseph Brodsky<P>
</B></CENTER>

The 21st century-with all its craziness, crookedness, and change-or-be-changedness-is already here. This new world is not for faint hearts, weak stomachs or stodgy minds. But whatever the future brings, "only gratitude will be gushing" from this soul. In the ageless words of Mabel Boggs Sweet, "God never wastes an experience."<P>

<P>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) warns that

inline roller skating--a popular new sport--can be hazardous if

skaters do not wear helmets and other protective equipment or do

not learn to skate and stop safely. As use of in-line roller

skates has increased, it appears that the number of injuries also

has increased.</P>


<P>CPSC recommends these safety tips to help prevent injuries with

inline roller skates:</P>

<p>

<ul>


<li> Wear a helmet, intended for use with skateboards or roller

skates, along with knee pads, elbow pads, and gloves. <br><br>


<li>Skate on smooth, paved surfaces without any traffic. Avoid

skating on streets, driveways, or surfaces with water, sand,

gravel, or dirt.<br><br>


<li> Learn to stop safely using the brake pads at the heel of most

inline roller skates. With one foot somewhat in front of the

other, raise the toes of the front foot and push, down on the

heel brake.

<br><br>

<li> Do not skate at night because of your difficulty in being seen

and your difficulty seeing obstacles or other skaters.


</ul>

"ST. NICK" was a real person!    Known as St. Nicholas, this individual lived
in Asia Minor (present day Turkey) in the fourth century.
He was a Bishop of the early church and was assigned to the district of
Myrna.
He is said to have been an exceedingly generous many, going out of his way to
provide anonymous gifts to the poor.
Over the years he has become the patron saint of cities, countries and
especially children.  The Roman Catholic church set his "feast day" on
December 6 and began to exchange gifts in his honor.  Reformers in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries (Puritans, Quakers, Baptists
and Presbyterians) were not happy with this non-biblical person and forbid
any celebration of the connected Christmas feast.
Into this vacuum rushed everyone else who had no such reservations:
merchants, party goers and of course children.
Father Christmas took over from St. Nick and Christmas was firmly established
as a secular holiday.  (The Dutch in New Amsterdam - now New York - held onto
their "Sinter Klass" which has been translated into English as  [you guessed
it] Santa Claus.)<p>

How have your Christmas traditions changed over the years?  Many of us
remember Christmas on the "farm," with wonderful smells of good cooking and
the ever amazing gathering of family, friends and neighbors.
Others remember special Christmas celebrations during wartime, illness or
little income.
It seems the ones we forget are the ones where everything went just
perfectly, we "got" what we wanted, there was not tragedy, no disasters.
The first holiday season I spent after my parents died was one of numbness.
 I sat in the midst of a great family gathering, watching games being played,
stories being swapped and a table groaning with food.
I didn't say much, but from time to time someone would casually wander over
and inquire as to how I was doing.  I'd nod my head and mumble something
appropriate, they'd smile and perhaps sit awhile, silently, by my side.
Then, after a while, they would wander off again.<p>

It wasn't until years later that I realized they each were taking a turn just
to sit near me.  Willing to take the time to attend to what ever needs I
might have.  <p>

The presents given that year are long forgotten, but the acts of love and
caring will last forever.
I and my family hope and pray that your Christmas season is filled with such
actions, old and new.  And with whatever gifts are exchanged, look deeply
into each others eyes and say "I love you!" (even before the gifts are
opened!)  ...and in so doing, make this Christmas one to remember.<p>

"It's in giving of ourselves that we receive, and in dying that we are born
to eternal life." (Prayer of St. Francis<p>

How's your life been?  How goes it with your soul?<p>

NAME="family">Being Family</a></center></h2><p> 


"Being family" is hard work.  Many of us learn that again as we work to pull
off the "perfect Thanksgiving" or the Christmas "like we used to have."
Today the stresses and strains of economic uncertainty, job loss and rising
costs play havoc on the best laid plans for a joyous, gift-filled Christmas.
The evils of family abuse, drugs, addictions and even crime have devastated
all too many families.  The struggles of getting the children to holiday
celebrations of now separated and divorced parents cannot help but dim the
excitement of the season.
It is a time when all too many of us feel overwhelmed by the world.  We long
for a simpler time, one filled with less problems and more joy.<p>

As we gaze over the long term sweep of history, however, we find things we
never as rosy as we remember them.
The rise and fall of nations, the sweeps of economic trends, the
devastation's of war and disease, have all left their mark on our lives.
Even the last few decades have not been without the shocks of assignations,
economic upheaval and personal tragedy.
The miracle of all this is not that people cope with all these things, but
HOW they cope.  
It's clear that some strategies for living (get all you can while you can)
will leave us desolated and alone.
What is often not so clear is the power and new-ness of life that God
provides even in the most common of circumstances.<P>

Christmas is the season when we celebrate the presence of God in ALL parts of
our lives.  
It's not just for a few weeks in December, it's not until the toys break and
wear out.  Christmas celebrates a deeper truth that changes our whole
perspective.
When we consider the gift of Christ in our lives, as a real and alive
presence, then our focus on getting "presents" is forever changed.
When we celebrate Christmas, the focus becomes giving rather than getting,
reflecting the love of God rather than going into hock to make others happy.
Christmas becomes an extension of Thanksgiving, a time of gratitude not just
for a good life, but for the gift of the Lord.<p>

Times are tough...  but the spirit of Christmas can be found in a
hand-written note, a simple meal shared among friends, a phone call not only
to share Christmas greetings, but a Christmas prayer together as well.
Let's not be distracted by all the flashy ads and music.  Let's promise to
spend some time together, as the family of God, as brothers and sisters
together in Christ.
Let's reclaim a Christmas that future generations will say: "We want a
spiritual Christmas, just like we had in 1996!"<P>

How's your life been?  How goes it with your soul?<P>

<h2><center><A NAME="money">Money?</a></center></h2><p>

"Money....  don't say that word too loudly in church!"<P>

I've been told that the number one reason people stay away from church is
that the church "talks about money too much!"
I guess that means that people are asked to give more frequently than they
want to .<P>

If that's the case, then I too would say that I'm asked too often to give.
 And try as I might, I just can't get away from it.<p>

Someone once wrote this modern day parable: "They want my money for the
McDonald's hamburger I buy, they want my money for the clothes and movie
tickets I purchase.
Even when I sit at home and do nothing I get requests in the mail to pay for
the utilities I use and the magazines I subscribe to.
There's no where I can get away from money!<p>

Perhaps if I saw money in a different light, as something that enables me to
be warm and comfortable at home, well read and entertained, clothed and
nourished with food, my attitude toward money would change.  Perhaps it's not
the money, but my focus that makes the difference." (end of parable)<P>

As we gather to be the body of Christ, as a close knit group of people who
seek not only change within ourselves but change in our world, we know it
will not happen without money.
Our church home has utilities and repair costs just as our personal house or
apartment has.  There are costs to the wonderful musical programs and regular
worship services.  
We want to provide the best Christian education we can for our children,
youth and each other.  We want to keep in touch through our newsletter,
mailings and other informational sources.
We want to have good and sound teaching from our leaders and we want to
recognize those who have given their lives and gifts to God by supporting
them as best we can.
We also want to be compassionate, helping those around us and around the
world who are less fortunate, coping with hunger, wars and natural disasters.<P>
 
We want an organization that is dedicated to spreading the good news of God's
forgiveness and love through Jesus Christ.<P>

In other words, we want our church to be like family, teaching ourselves and
welcoming new members, helping those in crisis and reaching out to persons
with deep needs. 
We what to challenge ourselves to think as God would have us think.  To
rethink our priorities and make sure we are going in God's direction.
And so we consecrate our "Estimates of our 1996 Giving", so that our church
leaders can prudently and wisely budget our funds in order that all these
hopes and dreams are realized.
We want to put our language of prayer, our quest for insight and our desire
to care into concrete actions, with real results and with accountable
responsibility.
So join us these two weeks of November, Nov. 12 and 19 as we talk about money
and as we celebrate it's gift of Holy warmth and Godly nourishment, Spiritual
Education and Missions Outreach.  
It's a word that should be said in church, even celebrated in church, for
what it allows all of us to do in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.<P>

<h2><center><A NAME="faith"> Will our children have faith?"<p></a></center></h2>

Will our children have faith?  Will we have faith?  Where will we
gain the
perspective to sort out and judge all the conflicting theories and
ideas that
surround us?<br>
Faith is that deep commitment to a guiding set of understandings
about our
world.  Faith is more than just knowledge, it is a trust in those
understandings that allows us to truly live.<br>
God calls us to trust in a way of living that is often at odds with
the
world.  <br>
Instead of the power and accumulation of things, material objects
and money,
we are called to put our highest value on each other.
Instead of counting our accomplishments and bemoaning our failures,
we are to
measure our love and caring.  
Instead of isolated wrestling with the inner prison of
self-centeredness, we
are called to look outward and see God's great creation.  We are
called to
open up our hearts and allow the love of Christ in.  We are called
to
honestly accept how much God loves us and allow the inner healing
that makes
all of us, no matter who we are or what handicaps we have, whole.
This is the life of faith.  One of promise and victory over the
world's
judgment of us.  One of deep peace and health even in the most
desperate of
circumstances.  It is a life that transcends the normal way we look
at
ourselves and challenges us to see ourselves as God sees us.

And such a Godly view does not stop there.  We are all called to
see others
in the same light.  We are asked to remove the scales from our eyes
and look
around us at people we may have known but perhaps never really
seen.<br>
We are asked by God to stand with the biblical heroes and leaders,
the
prophets and holy people and embrace them in the same kind of love
that God
has for us.<br>
This means not only working to put discrimination behind us, but
reaching out
in understanding to celebrate the differences that we all have.
Each person, whether they are rich or poor, middle-class or
upwardly mobile,
brings gifts and insights, stories and understandings that enrich
all the
rest of us.    <br>
God calls us to value people as the most important resource we
have.  And we
see each and every person living and breathing, eating and sleeping
in this
wonderful home we call Earth.<p>

"No one is an island"   John Donne reminds us and in this day of
ecological
awareness we become more aware of that than ever before.<br>
Let us be moved and shaken by our God who calls us to compassion,
insight and
love.<br>
Let us be loving as we explore and explain just how being a
Christian changes
us from the ways of the past into a new way for the future.<br>
Let us be bold as we invite others in loving ways to leave the
distractions
and dissipation's of their youth and adult living.  <br>
Let us look to a future that not only deals with the crime,
violence, hate,
prejudice and fear that the world offers, but overcomes it with
faith, hope
and love.<p>

These are not idle words, but the heartfelt motto of all who seek
to live in
Christ.  They are words that guide us and strengthen us.
They deepen our living and bring strength to our souls.
And they also reach out and beckon to others to find this live of
strength
and peace.  <p>

Think more about God as you go about your day by day activities. 
Bring up
the subject of faith and love as you speak with your co-workers and
friends.       <p>
 
Allow the presence of our Lord to become a growing presence  in
your life.        <br>
 And always be aware that you have something precious and valuable
to share
with those around you: faith, hope and love.<br>
Don't keep this good news to yourself.  Let others know what you
think about
God.  They'll thank you for life.  <p>
How's your life been?  How goes it with your soul?<p>

<h2><center><A NAME="violence">A response to violence</a></center></h2><p> 

The issue of violence in our society is now on  the lips of
everyone.  As our
hearts are filled with sorrow, and we shake our heads in disbelief,
a crucial
discussion has begun over the causes and circumstances surrounding
this
tragedy.<br>
We hope that one day the perpetrators will speak clearly about
their personal
motives, and until then we must be content with a broader analysis
of the
trends and threads in society that encourage and promote such
behavior.   <br>
Listening carefully to what is being said, we must first recognize
that is a
complex and many faceted issue.  No one factor seems to be solely
to blame.     <br>
 Yet within our understanding there are certain aspects that seem
more
connected than others.<p>
First: the growth of the Survivalist-Militia movement with it's
rhetoric of
armed response to the threat they perceive in our government.  
There is a deep  danger in their "resistance at all costs" doctrine
that
believes the election process and democratic checks and balances
are no
longer working.  Theirs is an attitude that is often fascist in
structure and
has the same inherent evil that the KKK and other extreme vigilant
groups
speak of.<br>
While not all militia's are extreme one's they all feed off the
same paranoia
that not only is America not working very well, it isn't working at
all.         <p>

Secondly, we are in a rising storm of violence reflected in our
movies, TV
and Radio Talk shows.  Much is being debated about the power of
"talk" and
the freedom of speech.  It is critical to democracy to recognize
it's
centrality.     <br>
In this debate, however, we have lost the place of common decency
and respect
for each other when we differ.  Ratings and advertising revenues
have seduced
even the most careful "talk" host into labeling others as "wacko's"
and
"malcontents."   <br>
When we resort to such name calling, the only result is that we
create more
animosity and hatred rather than loving understanding.
I am not being naive when I say we have to reach a National
"ethical
standard" to turn down the volume.  We know that speech inflames
and leads
individuals to consider actions they would not normally take. 
(That's the
point of advertising, isn't it?)  So we must respect it's power and
use it
carefully.       <br>
Calling for the killing of the President or any Federal officer /
employee
must be roundly denounced and shunned by all.  Civility and care
for one
another must be the rule or else our democracy will die from this
cancer of
violence.      <p>

Finally, we must call ourselves not to an attitude of "my country
right or
wrong" but to the more honest "my country right and wrong."
We have a history filled with successes as well as some notable
failures.         <br>
 One of our crowning glories is the ability to uncover those
failures and
even endeavor to make amends.  The apology to the interred
Japanese-Americans
and the effort to redress the wrongs of slavery and bigotry are
shinning
stars in our nations crown. <br>
We as a society have much to be proud of, even as we address some
serious and
problematic problems before us.  We as a nation have charted new
seas in the
history of the world and it has not come easily.<p>

I hope and pray that each and every one of us can speak out against
organized
hatred, work to turn down the volume of the rhetoric, replace
violence with
understanding and take pride in our ability as a society to grow
more
sensitive and to learn.<br>
We may be only one voice in the wind, but think of the power if
others begin
to join us!                <br>
Pray for peace, be courageous in love, the darkness will not over
come us!                      <p>

How's your life been? <br> How goes it with your soul?<p>

<h2><center><A NAME="easter">Why is Easter any different from any 
of the other holidays?</a></center></h2><p>

Candy and cute bunnies, clothes and Spring flowers are all becoming
the mark
of a more commercial Easter.  The culture is trying hard to
emphasize the
pastels and signs of hope as a way to mark the transition from
winter to
summer.<br>
Yet for Christians, people who have chosen the Christian lifestyle
as a
response to the fact that God has chosen us, Easter is
indispensable. <br>
All the other holidays: Valentine's Day, Halloween and even
Christmas could
disappear with only some minor adjustment to our Faith, but to lose
Easter
would be to lose the very heart of our faith.<br>
The Easter Story is more than new life and celebration.  The Easter
story is
one of great sadness as well as joy, filled with pain and struggle
as well as
victory and power.<br>
In fact, if we skip over the struggles Jesus faced, his betrayal
and his
death, we skip over the places where God stands by us most
powerfully.<br>
If we only take a few moments to celebrate all that is bright and
beautiful,
we lose the o opportunity for our painful and tragic places to be
comforted
and healed.    <br>
It is in fact that Jesus shared our pain, our lives, our hungers
and our
struggles that makes the victory over the grave all the more
powerful.          <br>
Here's a few ways to keep the eternal message of Easter before you.<p>

As you celebrate the holiday ("holy-day?") of Easter, take some
time to read
any of the Easter Stories of the bible: <br>
Matthew chapters 26 through 28<br>
Mark chapters 14 through 16      <br>
Luke chapters 22 through 24 or       <br>
John chapters 13 through 21.     <p>

These are the focal point of the New Testament.  We 
spend Easter
week reliving and renewing our memory of them.<p>


Come celebrate with us our Lord Jesus Christ who conquered the
grave!  Come
affirm the values of Love and creation that our God has given us. 
Come and
affirm that "nothing in all creation" can separate us from
Christ...  not
tragedy, not society, not government, not depression, not
distraction....<br>
 God has made an eternal promise in Christ that shall not die.
Thank God for EASTER!  Alleluia! AMEN! <p>

How's your life been?  How goes it with your soul?<p>

	<font size=5>I</font> love my wife, so I am trying to save her from a
practice I find bizarre and dehumanizing. I am talking about a fascination with
weather coverage, especially those on the Weather Channel.<p>


Weather matters, of course, when it actually gets here. A sunny day is nice, a
tornado is bad. But the growth of "weatherism" -- the increasing devotion of
newsprint, airtime, and now a whole cable channel, to data about the weather --
is a social menace. <p>



Why? Let me find my list.<p>



Number one: Pointlessness. Tonight local weathermen will give their confident
five-day forecasts for the temp and precip ahead. They won't go back and tell
us what they were saying five days earlier about how things would turn out
today. I love going back to look, and what I've learned is that you'll do just
as well if you stick to this long-term forecast: for the next few months it
will be cold, especially in the north. After that it will get hot.<p>



Problem number two: Self-pity. Yes the wind makes cold days colder, and
humidity intensifies the heat. But today's inescapable "wind-chill" and
"humiture" figures are really just ways to impress ourselves with the hardships
we endure. Why stop there? Why not new weather formulas to tell us how it cold
we would feel outside if we had no pants on, or how hot it would feel in August
if we were zipped up, at high noon, in a sleeping bag?<p>



Number three: Lack of pity for others. There's enough weather in the world to
create a disaster someplace all the time. Typhoons, floods, sinkholes. For the
people involved these really are tragedies, but when we see a new one every
night they become video wallpaper, spectacles. Meanwhile people in the Sunbelt
follow the weather reports mainly so they can gloat at those stuck in Duluth.<p>



Problem four: Erosion of individual initiative. People turn on the TV to see if
it's begun to rain or snow. Unless you're locked up in a dungeon, there is a
simpler way to find this out.<p>



Number five: Damage to higher reasoning powers. Last week, on the anniversary
of Pearl Harbor, the Weather Channel ran a historical special on the role of
clouds in the attack. "Weather, which made it all possible," were the final
words. Each exposure to such thoughts takes 1 point off your IQ.<p>



Number six: Philosophical danger: Weather reports makes us fret and worry about
a future that  probably won't ever arrive in the form we foresee. This
distracts our attention from the time we do live in, the precious Now.<p>



And number seven: Unseemly hubris. Our weather presenters are happy when it's
sunny, apologetic when it's stormy, and in general act as if they are in some
way responsible for the weather they describe.  God or Mother Nature, take your
pick, is not amused. He or she will strike them down for pridefulness,  unless
I get there first.<p>

<H1>The long hair site / section "Hair care"</H1>

<P><IMG SRC="car001.jpg" ALT="[Girl relaxing]" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=214 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=left>
Hair care is usually annoying. When you comb your hair, you get stuck with knots. When you wash it, is doesn't feel good. It looks unhealthy. Just "bad hair days".<BR>
Take some time for your hair. Especially as it is long. Use some time during the weekend for your hair, and relax. Don't believe that wonderful hair can be achieved by any product within a few hours. It usually takes a couple of weeks before you really can see a difference.<BR>
It is important that you enjoy your hair care - men will certainly enjoy your look when your hair is fine!<BR>
This section provides you with some gathered information about how to care for long hair. It might be helpful for you ladies out there (or for you gentlemen, if you have long haired partners) to obtain nice hair. The base for all this is however that you have the type of hair that is suitable for to be long. Not every women can wear her hair very long - many women with short hair should really wear their hair long, but there are also many women who should get a hair cut soon, as they are really not the type for long hair.<BR clear=left>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I am 35 years old, and for as long as I can remember I have had old-looking hands. My mother says that as an infant, I had very dry, wrinkly hands. I now use sunscreen daily on my hands to help prevent further lines and wrinkles, but I am wondering if there is anything I can do to make the skin on my hands look smoother. What about AHAs? If so, what percentage should I use, and which products and how often? Should I follow that with hand lotion? I ordered a foot cream through the mail called Podiatrist's Secret Total Foot Recovery Cream. Would you recommend this for my hands?<BR>
Kelly, Yorba Linda, CA<P>

<I>Dear Kelly,<BR>
A dermatologist can do nothing for your hands beyond the things you are already considering. Now it is just a matter of experimenting until you find the right combination. The foot cream you bought could be an option, but I suspect it may be a tad bit too strong for hands and much better for callused feet. Hands rarely ever require the same thing as the feet. The "secret" in this product isn't really a secret. It contains urea, which, like AHAs, exfoliates the skin and also works as a water-binding agent, plus lactic acid, for additional exfoliation. You may want to consider an 8% AHA product in an emollient base to see if it creates a smoother appearance for your hands. You can try Alpha Hydrox Lotion or Cream 8% AHA, which can be found at the drugstore. However, you still need to use sunscreen on your hands to prevent any damage. Apply the sunscreen after you apply the AHA product. One more consideration: Be sure that any time your hands are in water or you are using cleaning products, you quickly reapply your moisturizer. Nothing is more essential than keeping the hands well lubricated all the time.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
Which ingredients indicate superfine glitter in a product? I have noticed a soft, fine amount of shine in some products and would love to know what's causing that.
I think you might find it interesting that my hair is dyed red through enzymes rather than peroxide, and I find this to be virtually nondamaging compared to using peroxide.
<BR>
Carolyn, Roselle, IL<P>

<I>Dear Carolyn,<BR>
In regard to ingredients that create shine, the culprit is usually mica or iron oxides, but the label won't tell you how superfine the texture of those components is. 
But what product could you possibly be using that dyes hair through enzymes instead of peroxide? As far as I know, and I am pretty knowledgeable about this kind of stuff, unless you are using henna or a semipermanent dye, both of which coat the hair and are not really "dyes," all products that change hair color from one shade to another (meaning you get grow-out instead of the color just fading away) use only peroxide and an alkaline base. In all my research, I have seen no other option. The product you are using may contain an "enzyme," but I assure you it contains the other stuff too or it wouldn't work. Even if an enzyme exists that is capable of removing hair color or opening up the hair follicle to let in new color, that very process is damaging to the hair. Perhaps there is something else about the product you are using or the way you are using it (such as not pulling the color through to the ends of the hair every time you use it) that is causing less damage.

<P>Dear Paula,<BR>
I saw an ad for some new products that were developed by an Italian physician named Dr. Romano Cali. He is supposed to be a renowned plastic surgeon who has created beauty patches that are supposed to deliver special benefits quickly into the skin. They are supposed to have healing powers from botanical extracts and other natural ingredients. The three products cost $99.95 plus $10.75 for shipping. Are they worth it? They seem a bit of a bother. Youre supposed to peel off the patch and then apply it to the skin for 30 to 45 minutes. What a bother. But if it helps, why not. 
<BR>
Alexis, Miami, FL
<P>

<I>Dear Alexis,<BR>
The Methodo Medique Complete is not only a bother, it is also an incredible waste of time and money. Healing power of botanicals? Helps combat the ravages of time? So extraordinary Methodo has received worldwide patents? I want to scream. In fact, sometimes I wish I could just let out a flurry of curses at these companies and the marketing people who write their ads. For $99.95 you receive precut pieces of gauze shaped to go over the cheek area, eyes, and lips. What magic formula are these gauze strips covered with? Nothing more than Vaseline. Thats right, Vaseline, plus wax, plant extracts (which can be skin irritants), and plant oil. This is a greasy mess, and each box contains only four treatments. I can practically assure everyone who orders this junk that they will be grossly shocked and disappointed. I dont know about you, but if this Dr. Cali exists, Id like to string him up by his stethoscope.

Dear Paula,<BR>
I am an educator for Nioxin research laboratories. I have experienced first-hand the difference this product has made in the density of my clients hair, reduced to normal levels of daily hair loss. The sheen, texture, and manageability [are] also improved. Perhaps if you were a licensed professional able to know the salon experience, you would be a viable resource tool. You seem to discount the fact that if consumers did not notice a difference in their hair after using a professional product, there would be no market for it. <BR>
First and foremost, Nioxin never, absolutely never, claims to grow hair. Nioxin believes prevention is better than a cure. Nioxin is the only manufacturer involved in the science of treating "living hair," that is, hair [in its liquid state], not yet formed in the follicle. Nioxin is cold mixed, having no sudsing agents or alcohol. The herbs and botanicals, amino acids and proteins, are active, [and] even considered viable. Just the cleanser (not shampoo) has the ability to dissolve (not strip) the buildup of resins and toxins, specifically "DHT"(dihydrotestosterone), from out of the hair follicle. Nioxin has no resins. The cleanser will normalize the sebaceous gland and reduce the amount of hair loss back to normal levels (between 10 to 50 hairs a day).<BR>
The reason I wrote to you in the first place was to let you know that finally in the beauty industry there is a product that stands alone. Nioxin is the only manufacturer with a 10-year track record in the thinning-hair category. Nioxin has set an unprecedented new standard of integrity, reliability, and education. If Nioxin was not effective, if the product did not live up to its claims, it would be alongside the road like so many others I could mention.
Nioxin is now worldwide, helping individuals cope with excessive hair loss. I am not saying that Nioxin is a miracle cure or an overnight quick fix. How many salon products have medical doctors referring them? Or wanting to have the product available in their office for resale? Have you experienced the devastating effects of chemo or radiation? The clients are often more concerned about their hair loss than the threat cancer poses. Let me encourage you to reconsider the possibility that Nioxin deserves to be left out of the negative connotations, and re-evaluated.<BR>
Sincerely, <BR>

<I>Dear Glynda ,<BR>
As a consumer reporter, I have stated repeatedly that if a product works for someone that is just fine. People can have many different reactions to all kinds of products. Consumer Reports alerts consumers to possible problems and concerns associated with a wide range of products; that doesn't mean all consumers will have those problems, but at least they can learn about the risks. It is a grave error to associate the popularity of a product with its performance. Cigarettes remain quite popular, but their ill side effects are well known. <BR>
Like any consumer reporter, I let people know exactly what they are buying and getting into. You should see the hundreds of letters I receive each month from people who say, I've been using such-and-such a product but it isn't doing anything, or my skin or hair is worse than it was when I started,?and they mention products in all price ranges. Unless someone exposes the other side of the coin, meaning the stuff the manufacturer doesn't tell you, how will consumers ever understand what they are really buying?<BR>
As I mentioned above, of course there is a market for products regardless of their effectiveness. Nioxin is hardly the only product claiming to grow hair. I have several such products on my desk right now that men and women have asked me to review. Are they telling the truth too? Do all hair-growing products work? As a reporter I can investigate and discover what the research indicates and what independent researchers have to say on the topic. It is my job to report what I find, regardless of whether my findings agree with the manufacturer or hair-care professionals.<BR>
I am not a licensed professional (although I was at one time, but thats another story altogether). I am a reporter who has interviewed some of the top hair-care researchers in the country, read most of the current published research literature and studies, and had long talks with the FDA regarding hair-growth claims. Perhaps you should check out the FDA's Web page regarding hair-growing products. All of these nonlicensed?professionals tell me that hair-growing products (other than Rogaine) and hair-growing vitamins do not produce the results claimed, and if they did, they would be drugs or over-the-counter medicines, like Rogaine, and regulated accordingly. The bottom line is I have seen no published or even unpublished studies heralding Nioxins success.
There is some benefit to keeping the scalp clean, healthy, and stimulated, and to following a healthy diet. All of these steps can improve hair quality, but Nioxin is not the only product that can do that.<BR>
There are great products in all price ranges. It is my job to help consumers find the best ones, whatever the price, although less expensive is preferred. I never discount what works, only misleading information and unsubstantiated claims. Speaking of misleading information, you state that hair grows in a liquid state. That is not the case. Hair grows from an accumulation of normal skin cells that are formed in the follicle and then pushed up and out of the root. Also, in a cosmetic, botanicals and herbs are rarely, if ever, active,?and there is no proof that they impact the hair or skin in any significant way, at least not in any independent studies I've seen (and believe me, I read them all). Additionally, there is no evidence that toxins of any kind build up in the hair follicle or that they would have an impact on hair growth if they did. On the other hand, thickening agents used in shampoos and conditioners, particularly those for African-American hair, absolutely can build up in the hair follicle and stunt growth. <BR>
One more problem with your comments: dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is not in any way a toxin. It is an active, necessary hormone that regulates the anagen or telogen cycle of hair growth. The process is very complicated, but how the hormone DHT binds to the DNA in the hair root is definitely significant for hair growth, both healthy and unhealthy. Cleansing agents and herbs cannot affect hormones, nor can they extract them from the hair follicle. Thank goodness they cant or we would all be in a lot of trouble, because healthy hair needs this hormone too.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I recently read some information about the "latest and greatest" in anti-aging and anti-wrinkling called pycnogenol (beta glucan). After reading about it in a magazine I searched on the Internet and found additional information and products to order. It sounds fantastic if it really does what has been said it can do.
Thats why I am writing to you, the expert in what works and what's hype in the world of cosmetic and facial products. The two products I found for sale were Martin Pycnogenol Ultra Moisturizing Gel by Martin Health Care Products (1-888-867-9673) and Pycnogenol distributed by Healthy Source (505-856-5004). The product seems to be formulated as both a capsule and a cream.
Can this product really do what it says it can do: is it anti-aging and anti-wrinkling? If so, does it take the place of all the AHA products on the market or can it be used in conjunction with an AHA product? I look forward to hearing from you before I place my first order for this new wonder gel. Thank you in advance for any information you may provide.
<BR>
Trisha, via e-mail
<P>

<I>Dear Trisha,<BR>
I am familiar with the studies regarding pycnogenol (a plant-derived substance), and I am not convinced. I don't think it is a bad ingredient, and it does seem to be a good antioxidant, but that is neither spectacular nor unique. There are thousands of antioxidants in the plant and animal worlds, and many are being used in cosmetics. Antioxidant is merely the buzzword of the moment in the cosmetics industry, which means everyone has to have their own super-duper antioxidant. Pycnogenol is just one of many. Products from Cellex-C, which uses a form of vitamin C (Avon is coming out with their version next month), to Estee Lauders Day Wear, which uses super oxide dismutase, are the reigning celebrities in the antioxidant world. <BR>
I have been looking into this topic from day one, and there is no evidence, and I mean none, that indicates antioxidants can change, prevent, or stop wrinkling. All the commotion is generated because the theory behind antioxidants and some lab work done in this area are compelling, which is why they sound so good, but translating what you can prove in a petri dish to human skin is a monumental leap. I have interviewed some of the top cosmetic chemists and dermatologists researching cosmetics, and all of them said the same thing about pycnogenol or beta glucan: It won't hurt your skin, but the hoopla around it is absurd and will be replaced by the next super-antioxidant to come along, and that still won't mean anything for the skin.<BR>
Even if antioxidants work, their effect isnt anything you would see overnight or even over months. They are still, in theory, a preventive measure. However, one area where antioxidants are proving to be helpful is in sunscreens, where they can boost the effectiveness of the blocking agents. Now, thats good news. But dont rush out and buy a sunscreen with antioxidants. That entire topic has a lot of controversy behind it. I have been researching the issue of sunscreens and antioxidants for the past month and will be reporting on what I learn in an upcoming issue of the newsletter.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR> 
I know you must get a lot of requests to review lines, but the Precis Skin-Care System seemed so intriguing I thought it might really be worth the money. I want to know what you think before I invest my money. I too am one of those women who take your advice seriously, because when I havent listened to your recommendations in the past Ive more often than not wasted my money. I know that puts a lot of pressure on you, but, well, that s why you do what you do, isn't it?<BR>
Judy, Birmingham, AL
<P>

<I>Dear Judy,<BR>
It isn't all that much pressure. I can only tell you what I discover through my research, but, as you know, the ultimate decision is yours. Always be skeptical of cosmetics lines that don't offer a sunscreen that s at least SPF 8, and preferably SPF 15, as part of their daily regime. If not, as is the case for Precis Dermalogics, all the claims about protection and preventing wrinkles are completely bogus. Here are my product evaluations for the Precis Dermalogics line of skin-care products, which is indeed serious but not all that sensible.<BR>
Refining Cleanser ($15 for 6 ounces) is a standard detergent-based cleanser that also contains clay and magnesium; all that can be drying for some skin types. It may be OK for someone with very oily skin, but keep it away from the eyes.<BR>
Skin Refresher ($15 for 6 ounces) contains mostly witch hazel, water, grape extract, pH balancer, water-binding agents, thickener, vitamins A and E, plant oils, and preservatives. Witch hazel can be a skin irritant for most skin types.<BR>
Rehydration Complex ($25 for 2 ounces) contains mostly water, aloe vera, silicone oil, plant oil, a long list of thickening agents, anti-irritant, vitamins A and E, water-binding agents, plant oil, and preservatives. It would be a good emollient moisturizer for someone with dry skin, but the most interesting ingredients are rather far down the ingredient list. This product also contains aluminum starch, which can be a skin irritant, as one of the thickening agents, but probably not enough to be a problem for most skin types.<BR>
Time Defense Complex ($25 for 1 ounce) contains mostly water, thickener, plant extract, aloe, thickeners, vitamin A, DNA, water-binding agents, RNA, plant oils, more thickeners, soothing agent, and preservatives. Although this product contains some intriguing ingredients, triethanolamine, which is considered a potent skin sensitizer, is high on the ingredient list. It also contains diazolidinyl urea; triethanolamine and diazolidinyl urea can be an unsafe combination of ingredients. As interesting as it sounds to have a product that contains genetic material, there is no evidence that it has any impact on the skin whatsoever. I'm afraid this product has more negatives than positives.<BR>
Conductive Hydragel and Neutralizing Cleanser ($48 for two 2-ounce bottles of each product) are two products packaged together. The Conductive Hydragel contains mostly glycerin, plant extract, water, silicone oil, more plant extract, water-binding agents, more silicone oil, vitamins A and E, plant oil, and preservatives. This much glycerin in a product can be an irritant for some skin types. The gel can actually feel warm when you first put it on. Glycerin is a good water-binding agent, but in larger percentages it can take water out of the skin. This could be a good lightweight moisturizer for women with normal to dry skin, but only if they don't have problems with the glycerin. <BR>
What makes the Conductive Hydragel somewhat bizarre is that it supposedly has a positive charge that works in tandem with a little machine called the Precis Dermalogics Activator ($79), which uses  "positive polarity to propel Conductive Hydragel's positive[ly] charged" ingredients into the skin. In other words, the Activator forces the moisturizer beneath the surface layer of the skin. Unbelievable. I no longer encounter many firsts in the world of cosmetics, but this is a first. There is no research to back up the claims that this machine can do what it says, but it seems unlikely that an electrical charge will help the skin the least little bit. Besides, how deep is deep? The skin is only so thick; beyond that youre getting to muscle and bone. Most moisturizers penetrate to the lower layers of skin anyway.<BR>
The Neutralizing Cleanser is nothing more than a detergent-based cleanser that would be gentler on the skin than the Refining Cleanser above. However, nothing about it makes it "neutralizing." Also, I'm concerned: why does the skin have to be neutralized?<P></I>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
First, before I fling myself unashamedly at your feet to beg for your expert and much-anticipated advice, I want to thank you for saving me money, sparing me from disappointment, and opening my eyes to all of the ridiculous claims of the cosmetics industry. Before I bought your book Don't Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me (after reading that, I quickly went out and bought your other two), I thought of myself as someone who loved shopping for cosmetics but still made wise choices. What a laugh! Just what the cosmetics industry would want a consumer to think! How easily we're lured into making the most ludicrous purchases in the world while, with a self-satisfied smile, we slap down a credit card, confident we're making a wise investment in our skin-care future. <BR>
I very specifically remember scoffing at my mother's gullibility when she purchased the very expensive Creme de la Mer, while I, the more scrutinizing and discriminating consumer, purchased a $50 cream from Lauder a week later. I was supremely self-satisfied that I had spent $100 less than my mother and wasted no time didactically informing her that she needed to be wiser with her purchases. Since reading your books, however, I've completely stopped using moisturizer at all (I've got oily skin) and I could see the change almost immediately, it's clearer, not dull, and hardly ever breaks out anymore.<BR>
What your books do is provide consumers with evidence that cannot be ignored-telling us point blank, no two ways about it-that many products are simply incapable of doing what they claim. For many consumers out there (I was one of them), there is always that small amount of doubt (well, maybe . . .) simply because we don't know which ingredients are capable of doing what. I've already saved myself hundreds of dollars. My husband wants me to thank you too, because now he doesn't have to hear me ask him relentlessly after I've purchased new skin-care products, "Do you see a difference? Come on, dear, this will just take a minute. Does my skin have a bit more sheen than usual? Does the skin look thicker or thinner? Would you say that my skin is (a) glowing, (b) dewy, (c) translucent, or (d) shimmering?"<BR>
Now I'm wondering if you would be so kind as to review the Mariana Chicet skin-care products? I have several friends who just rave about them. Before I do anything, however, I want to see what you think. I understand they've been getting a lot of press lately. <BR>
Name withheld by request<P>

<I>Dear Reader,<BR>
What a great letter. You summed up perfectly why the cosmetics counters can be so seductive and misleading. I understand the intense pressure out there to get the best and the latest. For me, there has always been something very satisfying about sharing what I have learned about the insane world of cosmetics. Having interviewed and read the literature produced by so many inside sources who are leading researchers in the industry, I know just how really crazy it is out there. Your letter confirms that once a woman has all the facts, both pros and cons, she can stop throwing money at the cosmetics industry and still have beautiful skin. As for Mariana Chicet's line, it is reviewed elsewhere in this issue of Cosmetics Counter Update.

Dear Paula,<BR>
I usually do not take the time to write unless it is a complaint, but you are an exception. I want to thank you for two reasons. I started having problems with my hair about a year ago. It was acting very strangeparting on the wrong side, looking heavy, and feeling stiff. I spoke to several hairdressers and was told, "It's a cowlick," or "That's just the way your hair falls." I was very self-conscious and frustrated. Shortly after that I saw you on television talking about shampoos with conditioners that contain hairspray ingredients and what they can do to the hair. I changed my shampoo to one without conditioner, and the problem went away. That alone deserves a thank-you.<BR>
You also helped with my skin. I am 48 years old and have always had oily skin. I am Puerto Rican, and my skin color is sallow to olive. It has been impossible for me to find a foundation that works for me. Then I saw you on another talk show and you discussed foundations and which ones are the best and how to tell what the right color is. I can't tell you how much money I have spent on "makeup experts" who have sold me mauve correcting creams to put under my makeup to correct my skin color. You explained clearly the difference between oil-free and water-based foundations and [outlined] your inexpensive skin-care routine. I followed your advice and I can't tell you the difference. Who would have thought that my foundation would last most of the day! Thank you again.<BR>
Neida, Orlando, FL<P>

<I>Dear Neida,<BR>
Thank you for taking the time to share your successes with me. I am glad I could be of help. Letters like yours, which I'm pleased to say I get a lot of, make me love what I do.<P></I>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
I'm wondering whether you would be shocked by the rather unorthodox method I've been following for the past few months to exfoliate my skin. I'd read somewhere of a theory that men have softer, clearer skin because they shave their face every day. Shaving exfoliates the skin and thereby leaves it softer and smoother. I decided to try it, so during my nightly soak in the tub I lather up with Pond's Cleanser and Toner in One and, well, shave my face. I've actually found it beneficial in removing peach-fuzz, and my foundation goes on much smoother and looks better than ever before. I especially like the effect on the skin around my upper lip: it really does seem smoother. I know this sounds crazy, but I'm very curious to hear what you think. <BR>
Name Withheld by Request<P>

<I>Dear Reader,<BR>
I have learned to stop being shocked concerning a woman's pursuit of better-looking skin, although I have to admit yours is a bit more radical than most. I've heard the rumor about men and shaving repeatedly over the years; I just never thought a woman would consider that method of exfoliation. Shaving absolutely exfoliates the skin, which can leave it feeling softer and looking smoother. Shaving can also help nick off the very top layer of blemishes or clogged pores, which opens them right up and helps undo the plug. Alpha hydroxy acids, salicylic acids, and Retin-A or Renova essentially do the same thing for the skin, but without hair removal and more evenly. After all, you don't shave your forehead and crows-feet, or do you? Of course, nothing about shaving (or any method of exfoliation) changes or prevents wrinkles. It just makes the skin feel smoother and helps reduce blemishes. Men, regardless of how much they shave, still have wrinkles; it is just more socially acceptable for men to have wrinkles than it is for women. The bottom line: As long as you are not experiencing stubble or irritation, shaving is not harmful, and as long as you find it beneficial there is no reason to stop. If you do experience stubble or irritation, stop shaving immediately. That is what men experience, and for them shaving is no picnic.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I know you must be tired of always hearing about someone's cosmetic woes, but your books and newsletters have always helped me so much in the past that I thought you might be able to help with a problem I haven't seen you write about before. I have extremely sensitive skin on my body. I went to my doctor and she suggested I use Dove Unscented soap. I am still using it, but I continue to get rashes every time I take a shower. I'm not sure if it's the water or the soap I'm allergic to. I recently bought Dove Moisturizing Body Wash and tried it because I thought it would be less irritating than the soap, but I was wrong. I've tried so many products out there, even Cetaphil Lotion, but nothing seems to help. I would appreciate any suggestions you may have.<BR>
Marietta, Vancouver, BC<P>

<I>Dear Marietta,<BR>
If you are still experiencing this much irritation every time you shower, the Dove soap is not helping in the least and you should stop using it immediately. You said you talked to your doctor, but you didn't say whether the doctor is a dermatologist. For skin as sensitive as yours, a dermatologist would be able to prescribe a cortisone cream to help reduce the rashes and irritation. <BR>
I do have a few recommendations I'd like you to try after you stop using the soap. Please purchase some raw uncooked oatmealnot the quick-cooking type, but the kind you might find in a health-food store. Mix about a half cup of oatmeal with a teaspoon or two of water, and use that in the shower as a massage all over your body. Continue using the Dove soap under your arms and vaginally, but nowhere else, and be careful when you rinse to have the suds fall away from your body. When you shampoo your hair, also be certain to rinse so that the suds fall away from your body. I strongly suggest you try some over-the-counter cortisone cream (such as Lanacort or Cortaid) over areas that are particularly irritated. This should give you some relief until you book an appointment with a competent dermatologist. </I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I am 23 years old and have a problem with blackheads. I have combination skin, and the blackheads are worst on my T-zone, especially on my nose. I've tried just about every scrub and facial mask on the market, in all price ranges, and nothing seems to work. It appears the only way to remove them is either to manually squeeze them out, which people tell me is bad for my skin, or to go for weekly facials, which I can't afford to do. I recently saw an advertisement in a magazine selling a device that removes blackheads by "soft suctioning," using a "vacuum-air" method of some kind, or at least that's what the ad implied. It supposedly entails no squeezing and will not puncture the skin. What are your thoughts on this? If this device is just a gimmick, what do you recommend?<BR>
Traci, Houston, TX<P>

<I>Dear Traci,<BR>
I have seen that same device advertised in magazines since I was a little girl. Like you, I was enticed by the promise; the difference is I bought it. What a huge disappointment. Not only didn't it work, it left small red marks on my face. I believe that was one of the first times I was angry at the beauty industry. I was all of 16 years old. What I learned back then was if devices like that worked, who would ever complain about blackheads? It doesn't work, but it stays on the market, advertised in miscellaneous magazines for other unsuspecting consumers. <BR>
The good news is that squeezing is absolutely a good option for removing blackheads, and exactly what you would be paying a facialist to do. You already have spent a lot of your hard-earned money searching for the perfect scrub and mask, which means you now know those don't work. In essence, the most important thing you can do to get rid of blackheads is to stay away from harsh products and consider a gentle skin-care routine, such as Moisturel Sensitive Skin Cleanser; an AHA product like mine, Elizabeth Arden's Alpha Ceramide, or M.D. Formulations Facial Lotion; 3% hydrogen peroxide over blemishes and blackheads; and a facial mask once a week of milk of magnesia (milk of magnesia absorbs oil better than any clay mask)<P></I>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
I've read with interest your reviews of products that say they're oil-free but really contain hidden oils or other oily ingredients. My oily skin, which tends to break out, would love to know more about this. Could you list some of the chemical names and buzzwords cosmetics companies use in ingredient lists to disguise the fact that they put oils in their products. <BR>
Lorraine, Indian Harbor, GA<P>

<I>Dear Lorraine,<BR>
I wish it were an easy task to list the name of ingredients that can produce an oily feel on the skin, but that is more complicated a task than you know. Even silicone oils such as cyclomethicone or dimethicone can leave a matte texture on the skin, depending on the formulation, and have no effect on breakouts. What is perhaps most confusing is that even ingredients known for causing breakouts may not leave a greasy feel on the skin. Surprisingly, another one of the greasiest ingredients, mineral oil, has been shown in study after study not to cause breakouts. Go figure. <BR>
As a general rule, it is best to avoid any and all oils in skin-care products, including silicone oils, if they are high on the ingredient list. The only ingredients I would ever encourage a woman with oily skin to truly avoid are any ingredients ending in triglyceride, palmitate, or myristate, and ingredients such as jojoba (jojoba oil and wax can cause breakouts), lanolin, beeswax, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, cocoa butter, shea butter, and tallow (found mostly in soaps). Keep in mind that there are a host of ingredients that can aggravate oily skin and acne while actually feeling cool and drying on the skin, including alcohol, menthol, lemon, and mint<P></I>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
I'm anxious to get your feedback regarding the Pure Science? products from a company called Life Extension. I'm including a catalog and ingredient information.<BR>
Bernadette, Corona, CA
<P>

<I>Dear Bernadette, <BR>
Maybe it's just that I'm an eternal skeptic, but it is hard for me to take any product line seriously when it is being sold along with vitamins called Natural Sex and Wow. Nevertheless, Pure Science? wants you to take them seriously. What sets this line apart is the inclusion of 24-karat gold flakes in each of the products. I have to admit these are the prettiest skin-care products I've ever seen. But given that you can't wear them as jewelry, what really counts is what they can do. <BR>
First of all, gold flakes provide no benefit for the skin. Of course, Pure Science? wants you to believe that the gold flakes can aid in "cell exfoliation, skin purification, and increase[d] circulation." That isn't supported by any evidence other than their claim. Gold can't be absorbed into the skin-no mineral can-and it can't leach anything into the skin. Gold's skin-care value is perceived rather than real. And be honest: wouldn't you rather wear gold in the form of a necklace or ring instead of in a skin-care product?<BR>
Despite my doubts about the gold, I found the information sheet about the other ingredients in these products, for the most part, refreshingly honest. It describes aloe vera as being 99.5% water with a trace of other ingredients. It also describes the thickening agents accurately, as well as the AHA ingredients. Somewhere along the way Pure Science? got sidetracked, because the other claims are just plain silly.<BR>
24 Karat Gold Intensive Moisturizer ($39.95 for 2 ounces) contains mostly water, aloe, thickeners, AHAs, plasticizer (hairspray), more thickeners, plant extract, slip agents, and preservatives. This is a good 6% to 7% AHA moisturizer for someone with normal to dry skin, but if you ignore the gold (and you should) it isn't any more impressive than Pond's Age Defying Cream or Alpha Hydrox Lotion or Cream.<BR>
24 Karat Gold Eye Lift Gel ($39.95 for 1 ounce) contains mostly water, glycerin, water-binding agents, soothing agent, more water-binding agents, plant extracts, plant oils, vitamins E and A, and preservatives. This is a good lightweight moisturizer for around the eyes-if you aren't allergic to gold. It claims to lighten circles around the eyes, but nothing in this product can perform that function. Sometimes keeping the skin around the eye moist can help soften the appearance of dark circles, but any moisturizer can do the same thing.<BR>
24 Karat Skin Treatment Serum ($39.95 for 7 ampoules) contains mostly, water, aloe, alcohol, AHA, slip agents, thickeners, and preservatives. This is nothing more than a lightweight AHA product packaged in tiny vials that make it outrageously expensive to use. Alcohol is a mistake in skin-care products, and except for the gold there is nothing about this product that warrants any further attention.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I am writing to thank you for your efforts in helping women sort out their skin-care woes. Since adolescence, I have always had a few pimples here and there, but nothing to get too excited about. However, I am in my mid-30s now, and for the last five years or so I have been struggling with breakouts, constant breakouts. I have tried all sorts of skin-care products, I have been to dermatologists, I have tried Retin-A, I have tried herbal medicine taken internally, etc. I don't smoke, I don't drink more than a beer or so a week, I run 15 miles a week, I drink plenty of fluids, I take daily vitamins, I eat a healthy diet, I sleep well, etc. I just couldn't get rid of those breakouts; it has been extremely frustrating. To add to the complexity of the situation, I live in New England, where the climate changes swiftly; one day can be humid and the next day can be bone dry. And lastly, I am Asian, living in a predominantly Caucasian population that seems to think collectively that I should have "tougher" skin than they do. My husband uses rubbing alcohol as aftershave and thinks alcohol should be an appropriate toner for me!
Now, all things considered, thank goodness, life has been very kind to me. I am blessed with a wonderful family, good health, a good job, and happiness in general. But, being an engineer by trade and a perfectionist by nature, this acne battle has been quite resource consuming. Well, with the help of your books, I finally figured out my skin problem. (By the way, I found out about your books on the Internet.) See, every "expert" thought I had oily skin. Unfortunately, I also have very sensitive skin. So, while I was trying to stop the breakouts, the acne products that were prescribed or recommended to me were destroying my skin. I had a bout of eczema a couple of years ago after using a dermatologist's own brand of products. 
So, I tried your products for normal to dry skin, and guess what: my face actually feels pretty good. I mean, no tingling, no itching, and no new breakouts! I have also started using an SPF 35 cream every day. Anyway, after boring you to tears, I want to thank you again. Hopefully, my "dry" skin will calm down in the long run. <BR>
Eva, via e-mail (who has to look for something else to spend time and money on, now that my skin-care search is coming to an end!)<P>

<I>Dear Eva,<BR>
What a great note! Your story is outstanding. It is unfortunate that most people still believe that when you see a blemish you have to dry it up! Nothing could be further from the truth. Drying up acne, no matter what kind of skin you have, only makes matters worse by causing the skin to flake more, which causes more dead skin cells to fill up and block pores. What a vicious cycle. It's best to use a little 3% hydrogen peroxide or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide (ProActiv's is very good) over blemishes to disinfect them. That will help a lot. </I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR> 
A couple of months ago I saw an infomercial about a product called Sweet Simplicity. I ordered this hair-removal system because it claimed not to be like typical wax-based hair removers. After using it only one time, I decided it was no different than any other product I used to remove hair. Perhaps I was not using it correctly. Any thoughts about Sweet Simplicity?<BR>
Peggy, Englewood, CO<P>

<I>Dear Peggy,<BR>
My only thought about Sweet Simplicity is that it is neither simple or sweet. Well, that's not entirely true. It may taste sweet, but of course you're not supposed to eat this product. Sweet Simplicity, a sugar-based hair remover with a consistency like caramel, differs from wax only in content. Its performance is identical to most other wax products I've ever seen. Like any product that you spread on the skin and then rip off to remove hair, it can be messy, it can cause irritation, and the rate of grow-back is identical to waxing. The infomercial women gushing with amazement at Sweet Simplicity's performance are being more than a little disingenuous. Not that it can't remove hair well-it can-but so can any wax product. They just aren't mentioning all the drawbacks that can go with this kind of product. If you can deal with the mess it is an option, but it is not the wonder product the infomercial makes it out to be.</I><P> 
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
Thank you for your recommendations. I took a list of hair-care products you recommended for dry, chemically treated hair with me to the store. I knew my hair wasn't oily, but I never thought it was dry either. Anyway, I tried the Style Shampoo Regular and Style Extra Body Conditioner (because you recommended using a shampoo for normal hair and normal scalp and a conditioner for dry, damaged, or chemically treated hair that was thin and fine), and they've worked great! My scalp and my hair feel just right, not tight and dry and not oily and limp, and the products were only $1.29 per bottle! Here I was spending $50 every three months to belong to the Lori Davis Haircare Club, and these Style products work just as well for a fraction of the cost. So, as I've discovered, my hair is dry and I need to use the correct products for dry, thin, limp hair.
In summary, I look forward to saving money on hair-care and skin-care products, and your books came along at just the right time. I was beginning to ask myself why I was spending so much money on products that really didn't seem to do anything miraculous for my skin or hair. Plus, my husband and I live in the very pricey San Francisco Bay Area and we want to buy a house, plus save for retirement, and I'd rather spend my money on more important things than hair care and skin care. I used to think that to get the absolute best quality I had to buy the pricier skin-care and hair-care products. I figured that money was no object when it came to taking care of my skin and hair. I am now proud to say that because of you I am no longer a "cosmetics snob." <BR>
Thank you for all your research and hard work and for your honesty in uncovering the hype of the cosmetics industry.<BR>
Anastasia, via e-mail<P>

<I>Dear Anastasia,<BR>
Thank you very much for your comments. They are truly appreciated. In light of your feedback, I think you will find the next letter most interesting.</I><P>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
Well, I've finally had enough of your [garbage]. For the past year I've had to endure hearing you on TV babbling on like you know what you are talking about. I've had to pass your book when I've been looking for some real literature. Now I have something to say to you. It is your right to have an opinion about the hair-care industry and its products. Also true is the fact that it is only an opinion. You are by no means an expert on hair-care products or the industry. You are not a professional stylist who makes his or her living by using these products to create art, style, and beauty. <BR>
Part of my job is to make people feel good about the way they look. I know for a fact I cannot do that with Pert Plus or Salon Selectives. Have you spent any time with a hair-care professional? Oh no, that would be the right thing to do: get a full idea of what the industry is all about. Why would you actually want to get a broad spectrum of information before you shoot your mouth off? Did you talk to clients who use professional products and who used to use drugstore products? You talked to chemical engineers who broke down the products for you. Funny, did they break down the crappy drugstore ones too? You say the hair cannot be repaired because it's dead. Funny, why can't it? Can't protein bond with protein to help reform and repair? <BR>
Before you peddle your poison, maybe you should spend some time in the research facilities of some great hair-care companies like Joico or Matrix, people who spend vast quantities of money to constantly improve the tools I use to make my living. It's one thing to have an informed, full-bodied, widely researched, and unbiased opinion; it's another to spout off to sell books. Think of that the next time you're doing your dated do.<BR>
Michael, via e-mail<P>

<I>Dear Michael,<BR>
What a shame you are so angry that you can't see the forest for the trees. I spent many years working with hairstylists, and I have the deepest respect for their ability and work. I make that point crystal-clear in my book and whenever I appear on a talk show. My comments about professional hair-care products do not reflect on the professionals using them. After all, you are not involved with their formulation, you are only trained by the companies selling them. When the only information you have is from the manufacturer, naturally it is limited, or, at the very least, one-sided. 
When I did the research for my hair-care book I talked to the top cosmetic chemists formulating these products for both expensive and inexpensive hair-care lines, as well as to department heads of cosmetic chemistry at both the University of Texas and the University of Cincinnati. I read a great deal of the published research and a number of technical books on hair, including The Chemical and Physical Behavior of Human Hair by Clarence Robbins, one of the more respected chemists in the business. I interviewed at length the cosmetic chemists at Paul Mitchell, Revlon, Clairol, and L'Oreal. (Revlon, Clairol, and L'Oreal also make so-called professional products; for example, Clairol owns Matrix, and L'Oreal, which holds more hair-care patents than any other company, now owns Redken.) I also interviewed more than a hundred hairstylists from salons across the country. What I found, repeatedly, was that these artists knew an immense about styling but very little about product content, either within the lines they sold or in lines from the drugstore. They had preconceived notions about hair and hair-care products that simply were not correct or had no substantiation anywhere.
I have spent years doing research, and my area of expertise is product content and what is possible when it comes to hair growth and hair damage. I can tell you about the molecular as well as the texture and performance differences between most hair-care ingredients, in addition to the composition and nature of hair. For example, there are no published studies that indicate that proteins or amino acids can bond to hair or have any capacity for getting into the hair shaft and staying there. According to most of the researchers I have talked to (actually, all of them, but some were off the record), protein and amino acids, like "botanical" ingredients, are there for the consumer and not the hair. 
I know my information is shocking at times, but it is substantiated by mountains of research. If you could show me even one published study that supports your contentions, I would be glad to correct my position. In regard to your remark about the chemical analysis of hair-care products, both inexpensive and expensive products were investigated, and I did not have anything to do with that experiment. It was conducted by an independent lab hired by producers  of the Prime Time Live show I appeared on.

Dear Paula,<BR>
I have two teenage daughters. I have used your books and newsletter almost like a bible. Your tips and research have saved me lots of money buying for three women. All three of us are aware of how important the right shade of foundation is. However, each time one of my daughters' friends buys a new brand, they want to use a new brand too. So many companies in the inexpensive price range do not have testers or samples. And when has department-store lighting ever matched the lighting outside? My question to you is, Have you ever thought of matching colors from amongst the varying lines of cosmetics? (For example, Lancome MaquiDouceur Beige Neutral matches Revlon Age Defying Foundation Bare Buff.) This would be a fantastic chart to follow in cross-referencing the same shade in different lines.<BR>
Also, I recently became allergic to nail polish. My dermatologist suggested I use only those that are hypoallergenic. Any suggestions?
And as long as I have your attention, what do you think of the Glycolique line of skin-care products that is sweeping the salons in my area?<BR>
Keena, Corsicana, TX<P>

<I>Dear Keena,<BR>
Luring you with the promise of the next great product is what the cosmetics industry is all about. Teenagers are particularly vulnerable to this pressure because they are both absolutely certain they know just what is best for them and utterly insecure about their decisions. This constant imbalance is completely baffling to adults. I can't tell you how often I've run into a teenager with thick heavy makeup, a distinct line around her jaw and hairline, and a caked gummy mess around her nose and under-eye area, yet when I point it out to her with a mirror in daylight she simply doesn't see it, informing me that this is a very expensive foundation and some well-known actress or model wears it too. (I should mention that adults do this too.) Teens are notoriously susceptible to advertising or advice from friends that entices them to immediately change what they are doing, and also to advertising or advice that urges them to stand steadfast despite the evidence clearly in front of them. Please help your daughters remain strong in their choices and reaffirm that what's important in life has little or nothing to do with someone else having it better than you do, because sometimes what appears to be better isn't, and what's better for someone else may not be best for you. <BR>
Although I think that charting foundation comparisons is a great suggestion, the task would be more complicated and time consuming than you could ever imagine. The nuances in colors are vast, and the number of foundations per line, sometimes a half-dozen types with 12 to 24 shades per type, make charting even two different lines a colossal nightmare. Besides, regardless of the similarity between two shades, formula differences affect the color once it is blended on real skin. <BR>
In regard to finding a hypoallergenic nail polish, tell your doctor none exists. In fact, the concept hypoallergenic doesn't really exist in the world of cosmetics. I thought this misleading term was long dead. Where has your dermatologist been? He or she must think that "hypoallergenic" has some kind of meaning in the cosmetics world, and nothing could be further from the truth. There is nothing that makes any particular line or product more hypoallergenic than any other. Finding products you are not allergic to is a matter of searching and experimenting, especially when it comes to nail polishes, because the formulas and ingredients are so similar.
Glycolique sells an interesting trio of products. Refine Step 1 ($19.95 for 4 ounces) is nothing more than a toner that contains slip agents, plant extract, plant oil, and preservatives. It isn't a bad toner, just OK. Algae and seaweed provide no real benefit other than sales appeal. Retexturize Step 2 ($39.95 for 2.5 ounces) is an alcohol-based AHA product that is probably 6% to 7% AHA. I do not recommend alcohol for any skin type, and definitely not when using an AHA product. Restore Step 3 ($27.95 for 1 ounce) is a good moisturizing AHA product with about the same AHA concentration as Step 2. This one is best for someone with dry skin. However, I would never suggest that all three are necessary; one AHA product is all anyone's skin needs. I should mention that without a separate sunscreen product, these three steps would not be enough for anyone's skin. Glycolique's number is (800) 704-9277.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate your letter to me about hair care. I have thick, naturally curly hair that is also long-somewhere between Andie McDowell and Nicole Kidman. Finding products that don't dry, stick, gum, harden, and frizz has been a lifelong struggle. <BR>
I've tried Aveda, Sebastian, Nexus, and KMS, but what finally did the trick was Infusium 23 from Thrifty. I stumbled on it after the last Los Angeles earthquake: the person I was staying with used it. Their products are the best for curly hair, from the moisturizing shampoo and the leave-in conditioner to the five-minute conditioner (which I leave in all night) and the serum capsules. In 38 years my hair has never looked better. Please pass this information on to any of your readers with curly hair who have had the same problems I did.

<I>Dear Betty,<BR>
I just did.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
Please tell me what you think of the Tyra products I am using. I would really appreciate your feedback. They aren't all that expensive, but I just wonder if they are really helping my skin or if I could be doing better.<BR>
Helen, Dallas, TX<P>

<I>Dear Helen,<BR>
Without knowing your skin type or what you expect from the products you are using, I can only comment generally on the Tyra line of skin-care products, based on the formulas. I do find it puzzling that you think these products are attractively priced, but I imagine price is relative depending on what you are used to buying. <BR>
Tyra's brochure carries on about the skin's need for water: "Both the medical community and the cosmetic industry agree that loss of water is the leading cause of most skin problems." That is not an accurate statement. Dehydration causes dry skin, but few other skin problems. Acne, sun damage, pigmentation changes, sensitivities, allergies, and so on are the cause of most skin problems, and they have nothing to do with dehydration. At several points the copy explains that Tyra products will not clog pores. Tyra needs to check their ingredient lists more closely, because their products contain ingredients that definitely could cause problems for some skin types.<BR>
Phase I, Premier  Cleanser ($15 for 8 ounces) is a standard detergent-based cleanser that also has a foaming agent. It also contains lanolin oil and jojoba oil, which can clog pores. This would be appropriate only for someone with extremely dry skin, if the cleansing agents did not feel drying.<BR>
Phase II, Premier  Normalizer ($15 for 8 ounces) is a good but extremely standard toner that contains mostly slip agents, soothing agents, and water-binding agent. That's fine, but unimpressive.<BR>
Phase III, Premier  Moisturizer ($36 for 4 ounces) contains mostly water, thickeners, plant oil, more thickeners, and preservatives. It is a good moisturizer for someone with dry skin, but the price is absurd. This is so standard it's almost a joke.<BR>
Plus IV Deep Moisturizer ($44 for 4 ounces) contains water, plant oil, thickeners, a tiny amount of vitamins, soothing agent, more thickeners, and preservatives. It is an emollient but rather standard moisturizer. The only thing wrong with it is the price.<BR>
Hand/Body Lotion ($12 for 8 ounces) contains mostly water, thickeners, water-binding agent, soothing agent, and preservatives. It would be fine for someone with normal to slightly dry skin, but it's nothing special.<BR>
Luxury Shower/Bath Gelee ($12 for 8 ounces) is just shampoo with standard detergent cleansing agents and foaming agents. This one contains sodium lauryl sulfate, which can be drying and potentially irritating for the skin.
</I><P>

<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
Lancome has a toner, Eau De Bienfait, that you did not review in the new edition of your book. It is supposedly a cleansing toner with vitamins for the face and eyes. Does this help? And, of course, the eternal question: Is it worth the money?
<BR>
Janna, via e-mail
<P>

<I>Dear Janna,<BR>
Lancome Eau de Bienfait ($22.50 for 6.8 ounces) is a good but remarkably ordinary toner that contains mostly water, lightweight detergent cleansing agents, slip agent, tiny amounts of vitamins E and A, fragrance, and preservatives. As an extra cleansing step it is just fine, but the vitamins won't improve or help skin. This can be considered an antioxidant product, but the amount of antioxidants is minuscule and their effectiveness is unproven regardless of the amount. </I><P>

<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
I love your skepticism, I love your books, and I love your contributions to womankind! I'd like to share my personal horror story with you and your readers so they can be forewarned. <BR>
I'd always had extremely oily skin. I had a few breakouts a month, but my acne was mild. By my mid-20s it wasn't so bad at all. In fact, it was great, but by my late 20s I noticed some scars around my mouth near the chin, and some tiny ones on my cheeks. These scars really bothered me. I went to a plastic surgeon and requested a mild acid peel. He said that it wouldn't do anything. He said that light dermabrasion would work. So I was dermabraded. <BR>
Initially the results were thrilling, because my skin was perfect (if very pink). However, within the next six weeks, the swelling went down and I was dismayed to find every single flaw was not only still there, but worse! Also, the texture of my skin was sort of rough and grainy, and I scarred much more readily after the procedure. I cried for a whole year. I went back to the doctor and asked him to fix my skin. Again I requested a mild acid peel. Again he said that it wouldn't do anything, but he told me to come back a week later. I said that I had only four days to recover, so I didn't want anything too deep. <BR>
He gave me a phenol peel. It was really a horror show for about two weeks and somewhat scary for the next two weeks. It is hard to describe what it feels like to go from attractive to monstrous in the course of ten minutes, but that is what happened to me. I wanted to die when I realized that all those big holes in my face wouldn't just go away. In short, this procedure made me a million times worse. I looked like I had a disease. It was really horrible.<BR>
That was almost three years ago. Over the last three years, I have faithfully used my Retin-A, AHA, and avoided the sun. I have lost my faith in the medical profession. I had never heard of anyone being made to be as ugly as this doctor made me. I'm more normal-looking now. With the new CO2 ultra-pure laser, I had hope, so I made a few appointments with other doctors. I learned some interesting things.<BR>
The doctor who destroyed my face had a reputation for messing people up, even though he was board certified, but no one did anything about it. Apparently it took him about ten years to pass the board.<BR>
Doctors rarely, if ever, perform these procedures on thick, oily-skinned individuals because they do not work. I learned that I was not a candidate for even one pass with the CO2 laser.<BR>
All I could do was try a series of glycolic peels in addition to my usual routine. Another doctor suggested that I could wait a year for the YAG laser, which has a depth of necrosis about one-quarter that of the CO2 laser and is therefore much safer and less likely to scar. "But," he said, "it won't make much of a difference. You will never be happy with your skin. You can try the YAG, if you want to spend some money. It might tighten up the pores a little bit. Or you can try some glycolic peels. They might help."<BR>
So you see, I need all the help I can get. Every time I look in the mirror, I want to cry. I have a great job. I meet with professors and engineering consultants. I give presentations. It's important to look competent and good. I don't want to cringe when these people get within a yard of my face! I completely lost my confidence when I lost parts of my reticular dermis. As I said, it's not as bad as I am making it sound, but it is so much worse than my initial condition. <BR>
Please let this be a warning to any and all who are interested in these procedures. Please do not use my name. <BR>
Olive Skin and Depressed
<P><I>
Dear Olive Skin,<BR>
I am sad to hear you had such a devastating experience. I appreciate that you took the time to share your story with me and with my readers. I would also like to warn my readers that deep acne scarring is one of the most difficult skin conditions to correct, and the results from both dermabrasion and laser surgery can pose a great deal of risk or potential damage, along with minimal improvement. Any physician who promises results for this type of corrective procedure should be avoided. <BR>
In regard to plastic surgery, let me add one more concern. The trend these days for face-lifts is to do everything at once: specifically, having a face-lift and laser surgery at the same time. Several plastic surgeons I spoke to said they would never do a complete face-lift and a laser peel at the same time. When both procedures are done concurrently, you could easily end up with what I call the "Beverly Hills Pull"-skin pulled so tight the face looks strange, as if a smile and a wide-eyed expression were permanently embedded into the skin. <BR>
You ask for help, but I'm not sure how I can be of assistance. You didn't mention whether you need advice regarding skin care, makeup, or other potential surgeries. In the meantime, be aware that there are many ways to excel in the world. Some do it with beauty, some with brains, some with brawn, and some with style, as well as combinations thereof. In my opinion, and I monitor many aspects of beauty, the most powerful combination of all is brains and style, and that has little to do with physical beauty.</I><P>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
What do you think of the Earth Preserv line of products?<BR>
Gaylene, Friendwood, TX<P>
<I>
Dear Gaylene,<BR>
I think the marketing for Earth Preserv products is far more interesting than the products themselves. This line of hair and body products has more to do with fragrance than product choice. The Shampoo ($9.50 for 8.8 ounces), Hair Vitalizer (conditioner) ($9.50 for 8.8 ounces), Nourishing Body Bath ($9.50 for 8.8 ounces), Skin Moisturizer ($9.50 for 8.8 ounces), and Bath Crystals ($7 for 8.8 ounces) come in four very attractive scents: Autumn Woodlands, Summer Nectar, Spring Petals, and Winter Snowmelt. Also, all of the products are packaged in recyclable aluminum. Earth Preserv's brochure accurately states that plastic is a poor recyclable because the process is fairly costly, while over 70% of aluminum packaging is recycled. From that standpoint Earth Preserv is indeed earth friendly. But what about product performance?<BR>
Earth Preserv's claims that their products are "all natural" are fairly exaggerated. For example, they explain that their shampoos are superior to others because instead of sulfate detergent cleansing agents they use decyl and lauryl polyglucose and plant extracts. Decyl and lauryl polyglucose do not grow on trees, and there isn't even all that much plant extract in the shampoo. Their extremely beautiful catalog (more about this below) states that "natural means the pure substance or a natural derivative ?such as cetearyl alcohol from coconut oil." The brochure never explains how you get cetearyl alcohol from coconut oil. That process is most unnatural, and cetearyl alcohol does not resemble anything having to do with a coconut.<BR>
The oils used in the Hair Vitalizer aren't bad for the hair, but silicone oil, which they claim is unnatural, is more effective. (They do note that silicone oil can build up on hair, which is true, but that should not be a problem, especially if you alternate shampoos occasionally.) Both the Shampoo and the Hair Vitalizer contain clove oil and bergamot oil, which can irritate the eyes, so be careful. <BR>
Earth Preserv professes disdain for collagen and cholesterol because they come from animals; however, that is rarely the case anymore. These ingredients are now derived mostly from plant sources. Also, if one more cosmetics company claims that petrolatum causes breakouts, I'm going to scream. That is simply unfounded, and I've never found any proof otherwise in any research on acne. However, I've seen plenty of research that indicates jojoba oil can aggravate acne, and it is the fifth ingredient in the Skin Moisturizer.<BR>
Many of Earth Preserv's warnings are valid-for instance, it is true that sodium olefin sulfate and sodium lauryl sulfate are drying detergent cleansing agents that can strip hair color-but plenty of other companies also leave these ingredients out of their products. <BR>
In short, Earth Preserv products aren't bad, but the hair-care products are best for someone with normal to slightly dry hair and scalp or someone with thin or fine hair. They would be a problem for someone with dry, damaged, coarse, or thick hair, or someone who uses a lot of styling products. The bath products are fine if you like the fragrances, and the Skin Moisturizer is OK too, but only if you don't tend to break out. <BR>
Despite my criticisms, I must admit that the Earth Preserv catalog is stunning, with a wonderful array of bath products, including votive candles, bathrobes, towels, a beautiful slate fountain, one-of-a-kind picture frames, and other alluring items. If you are looking for some intriguing holiday gifts, this may be the place to shop. Earth Preserv's phone number is (800) 9-EARTH9. </I><P>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
I have come across another cosmetics line that looks tempting. Before I leap, I want your opinion. A lot of celebrities are apparently flocking to get their hands on these items. Please tell me about Vita-A-Kombi 1, Karin Herzog's Mild Scrub, and Karin Herzog's Soft Cleansing Milk.<BR>
Anne, Douglaston, NY<P>
<I>Dear Anne,<BR>
Don't all cosmetics look tempting? And aren't there always gaggles of celebrities doing such a wide variety of things to their faces and bodies that it would be impossible to follow everything they do in hopes of picking up their beauty secrets? I know we all think that whatever someone rich and famous does to her skin must be the best, but having seen what a number of celebrities use when it comes to makeup and skin care, I can honestly say that is not the case. <BR>
In regard to the products, the Vit-A-Kombi 1 ($50 for 1.76 ounces) seems like a bad joke. It contains mostly water, petrolatum, mineral oil, glycerin, thickener, hydrogen peroxide, vitamin A, and preservatives. This is a good moisturizer, but the amount of vitamin A in here is minuscule at best, and hydrogen peroxide is not stable in a cosmetic (that's why it comes packaged in a dark brown bottle; it deteriorates when exposed to air).<BR>
The Mild Scrub ($35 for 2.12 ounces) is just a mild abrasive (using marble powder) in a bunch of grease. At $35 it is absurd. You would be better off mixing a small amount of baking soda with Cetaphil cleanser (available at the drugstore for $8 for 16 ounces). <BR>
The Soft Cleansing Milk ($35 for 7.14 ounces) is just an average cleanser that is terribly overpriced. It is appropriate only for someone with very dry skin who doesn't want to get all her makeup off.</I><P>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
I recently purchased your third edition of Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me, and it is great. I also read your recent issue of Cosmetics Counter Update and was surprised by your comments on your own makeup. You stated that you used to wear blush and lipstick in both warm and cool tones. I thought you were a strong advocate of the "seasonal" color theory that says we should wear either warm or cool colors but not both. Do you feel that most of us can wear either one? I have been told that I have "warm" coloring, but I like rose much better than coral. As always, thanks for your expertise.<BR>
Mary, via e-mail<P>
<I>Dear Mary,<BR>
I am indeed very pro the seasonal concept of colors, but there are exceptions to every rule. Although I generally look best in cool cosmetics colors, I found that I could also wear salmon shades for a softer, more "natural" look. Salmon is kind of a cool/warm color because it takes pink and yellow to make salmon. Finding a makeup style that looks good takes experimentation, and it never hurts to find out if breaking the rules will work for you. In my case, I found that I can wear neutral/warm colors on my eyes and cheeks as long as I wear a more richly colored lipstick, usually a true red. As it turns out, that is pretty much a classic makeup look. Only the younger models wear neutral shades all over.</I><P>

Dear Paula,<BR>
I am enclosing as much information as I could gather on the Balenare Skin Care System, which I am currently using and from which I seem to be getting good results. My question is whether this line of cosmetics, which is not inexpensive, meets your standards of quality as well as competitive pricing. I have been blessed with good skin and did not have any problems with products I was formerly using. <BR>
Rita, Carrollton, TX<P>
<I>Dear Rita,<BR>
I am always hesitant to review a product line when a woman tells me she is getting good results from it. Half the battle in skin care, besides knowing what's in the products you are using, is finding what works for you. Both are difficult tasks. Still, it is hard for me to not be shocked and exasperated by the prices of the products you are using. In fact, the entire premise for this product line is inane. For example, the notion that "dermaplaq" is bad for the skin is just plain silly. This term must have been made up by Balenare's marketing people, because it does not appear in any of the professional journals I have been researching for years and none of the dermatologists I've spoken to have heard of it. <BR>
The notion that cosmetic buildup exists and that it is dangerous for the skin is bizarre. Definitely, if you don't clean your skin, makeup can build up, but even the simplest skin-care routine can take care of that problem. And, yes, skin cells can accumulate for some skin types (for example, sun-damaged skin, dry skin, or oily skin), but that problem is easily handled by simple cleansing and using an exfoliant, such as an AHA product or even a washcloth. It doesn't takes a $200 skin-care routine. Furthermore, any skin-care line that touts such miracles but doesn't include an SPF 15 product as part of their primary skin-care routine is uninformed. <BR>
Here are my comments on the Balenare skin-care products. <BR>
Cleansing Lotion contains mostly water, thickeners, plant extracts, plant oil, thickeners, detergent cleansing agents, more thickeners, and preservatives. The minuscule amounts of vitamins are almost silly, but there are enough oils to cause buildup on the skin. Jojoba oil in particular can clog pores.<BR>
Buffing Creme is a standard cleansing cream that contains papaya and salicylic acid. It is an OK exfoliant, but I am not fond of recommending these two ingredients for exfoliating the skin. It also contains mint and lemon, which can be skin irritants.<BR>
Orange Papaya Cleansing Gel is a standard detergent cleanser that lists sodium lauryl sulfate as the second ingredient. That makes it a fairly strong cleanser that can be too drying for most skin types. By the way, I am not surprised Balenare suggests washing with this after you wash with the Cleansing Lotion; you may need another cleanser to remove the greasy residue left by the Cleansing Lotion.<BR>
Aqua Freshener is just water, witch hazel, alum (like a styptic pencil), boric acid, plant extracts, and preservatives. Witch hazel can be a skin irritant and alum can be drying. This product would be appropriate only for someone with oily skin, and even then I probably wouldn't recommend it.<BR>
Face Value (Dermaplaq Free) contains mostly water, several thickeners, papaya (as an exfoliant), plant oil, more thickeners, more plant oils, vitamins, silicone oil, water-binding agent, salicylic acid, plant extracts, tiny amounts of more water-binding agents, and preservatives. This is an emollient moisturizer that also contains exfoliants. It's fine, but only one exfoliating product is needed in any skin-care routine.<BR>
Perfect Balance P.M. contains mostly thickeners, plant oils, vitamins, water-binding agent, plant extracts, and preservatives. This is a good moisturizer for dry skin, but that's about it. By the way, this product lists liposomes as an ingredient, which is misleading. Liposomes are a delivery system, a way of formulating a product, not a specific ingredient.<BR>
Maximum Day Care is similar to the product above, but with a tiny amount of sunscreen. Without an SPF 15, this is useless for daytime.</I><P>
<P>
Dear Paula,<BR>
My daughter has both of your books and I was looking over the new edition the other day. I was surprised to read your review of the only product I have been loyal to for over six years Clarins Skin Firming Concentrate. I started using this product at the recommendation of my best friend. At the time she was about to celebrate her 40th birthday. Her friends and her husband's family all thought it was her 30th. She had no wrinkles at all, and her eye area was as firm as a teenager's. She told me that she had been using the Clarins Concentrate for many years. <BR>
I had major frown lines between my eyebrows that I couldn't stand. Before I used up the first jar of the Serum, the lines had all but disappeared. I started using it all around my eyes. As I approached 40 years old, I began noticing the feathering of my lipstick. I remember my mom using many different products to try to stop it. I started using this product on my lips, and within a few weeks the feathering disappeared totally! I am 41 years old and pregnant with my fifth child. Many people tell me I look too young to have five children, and they are even more amazed to hear that my oldest is 15! I am constantly being told that I look like I am in my early 30s. I am positive that the Clarins Skin Firming Concentrate is the reason why. <BR>
It is obvious from your comments about this product that you never bothered to actually test it or talk to someone who has been using it. Unless you are going to give a product a fair review, it should not be included in your book!<BR>
Suzanne, Santa Maria, CA <P>
<I>Dear Suzanne,<BR>
I make it very clear in my book that I do not review products from experience but rather from formulation versus claims. If a product contains standard cosmetic ingredients but makes elaborate claims about eliminating wrinkles, or if it contains potentially irritating ingredients but claims to be good for sensitive skin, and so on, I point that out.<BR>
I believe my reviews to be completely fair. I have never said that using a moisturizer would not improve the appearance of skin. However, in no way can the ingredients in the Clarins product cure wrinkles. It is just not humanly, or should I say cosmetically, possible. This product doesn't contain anything that doesn't show up in a thousand other products making the same claim. And, actually, this formulation is rather dated and lacks a lot of the new skin-care ingredients that may work even better in terms of smoothing the skin. What do you make of the 10,000 other anti-wrinkle products on the market; are they all unreliable and Clarins the only answer? And what about Clarins' other anti-wrinkle products; if they are also capable of living up to their claims about wrinkles, why be loyal to just this one?<BR>
It is clear you have found a product that works well for you, and that is great. You are completely at liberty to believe whatever you want to. You don't have to agree with my review, but the information is solid and backed up with an immense amount of research and substantiation from cosmetic chemists at universities and cosmetics companies all over the country.</I> <P>

<P><B>SPOTTED PENIS MYSTERY</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Dear Alice,</P>

<P>I know that having intercourse at a time when I have a vaginal infection
will cause my partner to become infected, i.e., red spots on the penis.
 What could cause him to get this when I'm not having any symptoms?<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>

<P>Red spots on the penis could be caused by an allergic reaction to the
spermicidal jelly or cream you are using for contraception, or by the nonoxynol
or lubricant that is on condoms.  Red spots can also be caused by something
that you have that is asymptomatic in you.  It sounds as if you are already
on the case, and now have some variables to test as well.  There also seems
to be sufficient reason to get yourself, and your partner, checked for STDs
(sexually transmitted diseases).  If you are a Columbia student, you can
make an appointment with Health Services by calling x4-2284, then pressing
2.  If you are not a Columbia student, you can go to the nearest city or
county health department's STD clinic (they usually have  a great deal of
experience with STDs), or to your own private doctor.  </P>

<P>Good luck on your search for the solution to the spotted penis mystery.<BR>

<title>Testing for asymptomatic herpes</title>
</head>

<body>
<h3>Herpes testing</h3>
<br>
Dear Alice,

<p>
<i>Question one:</i><p>
This service is a God-send. I feel more informed than I did a few 
days ago. 
<p>
I have a few questions regarding Herpes Simplex 2. Can you be tested 
for the virus even if an active sore is NOT present? And what are the 
signs to know if the virus is shedding even if there are no sores or 
related pain?
<br>
-- Want to be safe
<br>
<p>

<i>Question two:</i><p>
My ex-girlfriend had (has) genital herpes. We always used condoms, 
and never had sex during outbreaks. I don't have any symptoms, but 
am worried about possibly being asymptomatic. I want to start new 
relationships, but I'm reluctant because I don't know what to tell 
new partners. Is there a reliable test for asymptomatic people? --
<br>
-- Anxious to resume
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p>Dear Want to be safe & Anxious to resume,<p>

In view of herpes frequently asymptomatic state, the ease of 
passing it to someone else, along with the general regard (however 
questionable) in this society that herpes is a bad thing to have, 
people want to know if they have been infected. Through the many 
similar questions that are asked, Alice understands your concern. 
Unfortunately the news is that there is not currently a <i>useful</i> 
blood test for herpes simplex virus type 2, the most common cause 
of genital herpes.
<p>
Any reasonably comprehensive laboratory can offer herpes antibody 
testing. That sounds like what's needed, right?  Well, the problem 
here is that it's a bad test. There is a marked overlap between its 
ability to detect
antibodies (immune proteins that are part of the body's defense 
system against specific infections) to type 1 (the main cause of oral 
herpes) and type 2. That is, many adults, an estimated 50-90%, 
acquired type 1 infection in childhood as an oral or throat infection. 
Many of these people will appear to have positive antibodies on the 
current test against type 2 herpes.  So a positive antibody test for 
herpes type 2 is unreliable. And to make things even harder, type 1 
herpes can certainly cause genital infection.
<p>
Twenty to thirty percent of U.S. adults are believed to have herpes
type 2 antibodies. That percent is pretty high. Without doubt, the 
majority of that large number are unaware of being infected. In a  
study done in a STD clinic, clinicians found that 60% of infected 
women never had any symptoms and another 16% had no recent 
symptoms. Are they all contagious? How contagious?  Were some 
never contagious? We just don't know the answers to these 
questions.
<p>
Asymptomatic signs or viral shedding would be very difficult to 
determine, although some people can tell before an outbreak is about 
to occur...they feel more irritable, on edge, and may have a tingling 
or itching sensation at the site where the blister is going to form.
<p>
Herpes is not the worst thing in the world, and the current 
unsatisfactory state of testing will change.  Try not to be overly 
concerned.  In each of your situations, it is likely that you are not 
infected or that you developed a strong immune response early in 
your life or after you became sexually active.  Alice would advise 
you, however, to continue practicing sex in safe ways and discussing 
the many reasons you do so with your future partners. Whether or not 
you or a partner is infected with herpes, many other, more serious 
sexually transmitted diseases don't show any symptoms, either.

Urinary Tract Infection
</title>
<h3>
Urinary Tract Infection
</h3>
<br>
Alice, I think I may have some kind of urinary tract infection. It came on very suddenly, about three nights ago. And when I pee, there is a burning sensation when my bladder has almost emptied. It's not an STD because I'm in a monogamous relationship, and yes, I'm sure! Please help. Thank you. --Burning Up

<hr>
<br>
<p>Dear Burning Up,<br>
Urinary tract infections(UTIs) are so common that most women get at least one at some point in their lives. They are usually caused by bacteria, such as E. coli, which travel from the colon to the urethra and bladder (and occasionally the kidneys). Trichomoniasis and chlamydia can also cause UTIs; stress, low resistance, poor diet, damage to the urethra from childbirth, surgery, etc., can predispose you to getting them. Often a sudden increase in sexual activity triggers a case of "honeymoon cystitis", or urinary tract infection. 

<p>Cystitis is the most common form of UTI. While the symptoms may scare you, it is rarely serious if treated. Symptoms include:
<UL>
<LI>feeling like you need to urinate every few minutes
<LI>burning like crazy when you try to urinate
<LI>many times, hardly any urine comes out
<LI>possibly blood in the urine
<LI>sometimes pain just above your pubic bone
<LI>sometimes a peculiar odor to your first urine in the morning
</UL>
<p>To prevent UTIs, treat mild infections and avoid reinfections, try the following self-help measures:
<UL>
<LI>Drink lots of fluids every day.
<LI>Urinate frequently and try to empty your bladder completely each time.
<LI>Wipe yourself from front to back after urinating and moving your bowels, trying to keep the bacteria in your bowels away from your urethra.
<LI>You and your partner should clean your hands before having sex, and after contact with the anal area before touching the vagina.
<LI>Make sure you are well-lubricated before intercourse.
<LI>Empty your bladder before and after sex.
<LI>Change sanitary napkins frequently during your period.
<LI>Wear loose clothing.
<LI>Cut down on caffeine and alcohol. With an active infection, eliminate both. 
<LI>Cut down on sweets.
<LI>Drink unsweetened cranberry juice.
<LI>Eat well and get enough rest. 
<LI>Keep your stress levels down, if possible.
</UL>
<p>When a UTI doesn't respond to self-help treatment within 24 hours or recurs frequently, see a medical provider. Treatment is usually with antibiotics, and a drug called Pyridium, which will relieve the pain and turn your urine a bright orange. Untreated UTIs can lead to serious infections of the kidneys, so if pain and symptoms persist, make sure you see a provider.

<p>At Columbia, if you think you have a urinary tract infection, make an appointment at Women's Health by calling 4-2284. Outside the University, see your regular medical provider or gynecologist.

Urinary tract infection?
</title>
<h3>
Urinary tract infection?
</h3>
<br>
Dear Alice,
<p>      For the second time this year, I have had a bout of what I think 
      might be a u-tract infection, but I'm not sure if that's what it 
      is. For about a week now I have had the urgency to urinate 
      hundreds of times throughout the day, and could easily urinate 
      every five minutes without problem. The bothersome thing is that, 
      although I'm not incontinent, it is dripping a little and is 
      therefore very unpleasant and awkward. I'm not experiencing any 
      burning sensation, and I know that I'm not pregnant. Any advice? 
      (I started drinking cranberry juice yesterday, thinking that might 
      help I'm not exactly sure why).
<p>      Thanks,
<br>      Slightly embarrassed.

<hr>
<br>
Dear Slightly embarrassed, 

<p>There are any number of causes of the symptoms you're 
      experiencing. You need to have a culture done to determine the 
      exact cause and appropriate treatment. It is not a good idea to 
      leave this type of infection untreated, because it can spread 
      through other parts of your body, sometimes asymptomatically. 
      Please walk-in to health services before you leave for break, or 
      see you family doctor as soon as you get home. In the meantime, 
      there is nothing to lose by drinking cranberry juice. Unsweetened 
      cranberry juice makes your urine more acidic, providing a 
      unsupportive environment for bacteria to proliferate. You can also 
      try eliminating caffeine and alcohol, both of which irritate the 
      bladder. If you can't eliminate them during finals, at least try 
      to drink less of them and drink enough water throughout the day to 
      dilute them. Also, many women find that cutting down on refined 
      sugars helps lessen the severity of urinary infections, and 
      prevent them from happening in the first place. These are mostly 
      precautionary measures, you really need to see a clinician as soon 
      as possible to take care of the issue at hand.

Giant hail storm destroys Polk County citrus crops</a></font></h1><br>

<img src="cispacer3.gif">  Specific incidents of hail damaging Florida citrus have been
 poorly documented since growers are usually unprepared to acquire and interpret 
 scientific information regarding the amount and type of hail that damages their crops.
   References to hail in the citrus literature are usually limited to a notable 
   photograph and a short paragraph about the uniqueness of the climatology.  
   Hail is not even indexed in any edition of Citrus Growing in Florida.  On many 
   crops (including citrus in Japan), considerable effort has been expended into hail 
   suppression research.  However, most citrus references implicitly agree that little 
   can be done to prevent hail damage due to the cost of management and the constantly 
   changing conditions in Florida hailstorms that preclude forecasters from issuing 
   sufficiently advanced warnings.  An informal survey of growers and weather 
   observers suggested that giant hail events in a given Florida citrus grove occur 
   only once or twice every 100 years; thus, this article serves as the most complete 
   non-technical description of such a rare meteorological event.  Readers wishing 
   more quantitative information about the storm are referred to the companion 
   article on hail crop damage presented in the 1996 Proceedings of the Florida State 
   Horticultural Society. <br>
   
  
  
  <p align=Left>

<font size=+1><b>Features of the storm.</b></font><br>
  <img src="cispacer3.gif">On March 30, 1996, at approximately 2:30 p.m., a severe hailstorm occurred 
  in Polk County that resulted in catastrophic losses to some citrus crops.  
  The storm migrated eastward through Polk County from eastern Hillsborough 
  County traveling through parts of Lakeland, Highland City, Bartow and 
  Lake Wales.  Some hailstones exceeding the size of softballs were reported, 
  but most were 2 to 3 inches in diameter (Fig. 1).  This thunderstorm composed 
  of a tall cumulonimbus cloud with a strong central updraft and circulation 
  vortex met the defined requirements of a "supercell" storm.  Giant hail 
  (i.e. hail greater than 2 to 3 inches in diameter) precipitated over a 
  wide belt of Polk County as the storm traveled eastward.  Thunder, lighting 
  and tornadoes accompanied the storm, and Federal Aviation Administration air 
  traffic controllers reported that the sky turned as "black as ink" immediately 
  prior to some hail events.  Ground temperatures during the storm were 
  approximately 80<SUP><FONT SIZE= "-4">o</FONT SIZE></SUP> F, while temperatures near 50,000 feet approached - 100<SUP><FONT SIZE= "-4">o</FONT SIZE></SUP> F.  
  Updraft and horizontal windspeeds were estimated by the NWS at much greater 
  than 100 mph.
  
  
  
  <br>
  <p align=Left>

<font size=+1><b>Crop Damages.</b></font><br>
  <img src="cispacer3.gif">The NWS did not acquire official estimates 
  of crop damages associated with the storm.  However, several unharvested 
  citrus groves were in the storm trajectory and included red grapefruit and 
  orange varieties targeted for fresh markets.  The hail caused biological 
  losses of approximately 90% with the trees exhibiting extensive leaf loss 
  and 30 to 50% of the crop knocked off the trees.  Leaves were extremely 
  tattered and both leaves and small branches were lobbed to the ground.  
  Some fruits on the ground appeared with undamaged rinds, so strong winds 
  may have contributed to the crop losses.  Sub-terminal bark lesions were 
  also extensive.

<font size=+1><b>Damages during the storm.</b></font><br>
  <img src="cispacer3.gif">  Some recently set fruits that were to be harvested 
  the following season were damaged or dislodged, so the hail affected the 
  following seasons crop and tree health.  Of those mature fruits that escaped 
  dislodging by the hail, many showed lesions of completely severed large 
  sections (Fig. 2). On fruits struck to the ground, some were found with 
  approximately 1 inch hail imbedded inside, indicative of a high energy of 
  impact.  Interestingly, lesions often occurred in an "inverted-V" shear.  
  Apparently, hail initially impacted the upper half of exposed fruits.  
  The energy propelled the hail into the fruit, shearing the rind open as 
  it continued to travel on into the flesh, splitting it into the inverted-V 
  laceration.  In oranges, if hail impacted the fruit at a trajectory directed 
  toward the central axis, then it sometimes became imbedded in the flesh.  
  However, if the impact trajectory was directed off-center, the velocity of 
  the hail more likely propelled it on past the fruit, severing that sector of 
  the fruit into which it came into passing contact.  Due perhaps to their 
  thicker rinds, grapefruits appeared more likely to contain imbedded hail, 
  regardless of the impact trajectory of the hail.  In almost all instances, 
  hail lacerations on oranges were more traumatic than on grapefruits subjected 
  to equivalent hail shock.

<font size=+1><b>Damages several weeks after the storm.</b></font><br>
  <img src="cispacer3.gif">  Site investigations several weeks following 
  the hailstorm confirmed as expected that the damages worsened over time.  
  In addition to punctured oil gland injuries, fruit droppage increased as 
  ethylene-activated abscission cell layers continued to dislodge injured 
  fruits.  Fruit flies, insects associated with fruit decay and secondarily 
  pathogenic fungi symptomatically identified as Phytophthora citrophthora, 
  Penicillium spp. and Endomyces geotrichum, invaded remaining damaged fruit 
  tissues, resulting in injuries and infections sufficient to drop fruit which 
  were not dislodged by the physical impact of the hailstones themselves.  
  Similar infections developed on many apparently undamaged fruits on the 
  ground, rendering salvage operations impractical.  It was also 
  increasingly evident that flowering and fruit set were decreased as the 
  crop set appeared lower in the hail-affected trees than in trees not damaged 
  by the giant hail.

<font size=+1><b>Damages six months after the storm.</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif">  Six months after the storm, many of the current season's 
fruits manifested injuries that developed from the hail impact occurring the 
previous Spring.  These were fruits that set prior to the Spring storm, 
but were not dislodged by the impacting hail.  These fruit could escape  
the initial dislodging due to their small size and comparatively elastic rind, 
which enabled them to be knocked to the side as the hail came into contact with 
them.  Symptoms appearing on these fruits later in the year consisted primarily of 
"pockmark" lesions on the rind.  Citrus rust mite populations and greasy spot 
disease did not appear dramatically different on the hail affected fruits and 
leaves - at least at the 3 to 6 ft height at which most fruits were sampled.  
Wood rots were found to occur on some of the hail damaged branches, especially 
those in which the terminal points were severed or killed.  However, most 
sub-terminal branch lesions were found to be healing over and the leaves 
and fruits on these branches appeared relatively healthy, although maturing 
slightly earlier than usual.  Many tattered and torn leaves did not exfoliate, 
but were found still to be attached to the trees in the Fall, enabling them to 
continue sourcing photosynthates to the maturing crop.
 <br>


<br><hr width=75%>
      
      <p align=Left>


<font size=+1><b>Damages to next season's crop.</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif">  Crop and economic losses from the hail storm 
extended into the following season.  Dead wood was more prevalent in the 
hail-affected groves than in groves that escaped the storm, especially in 
the tops of canopies exposed to the direct impact of the incoming hail.  
In fact, these canopy tops appeared with a preponderance of dead 
branches - thinned and somewhat "ragged".  Consequently, the incidence 
and severity of melanose lesions appeared somewhat greater in the 
hail-affected trees, despite the application of an additional 77% cupric 
hydroxide spray (50% metallic cupric ion) to manage the epidemic.  
This damage/disease profile suggested that severely hail damaged 
trees may benefit from a follow-up hedging/topping/cleaning program 
to help reduce the inoculum potential of melanose disease in subsequent 
seasons.  Standard quality tests indicated that fruits on trees and branches 
stressed by the hail matured slightly earlier than fruit on trees and branches 
not subject to the physical hail stress, rendering first market, high value 
crop harvest operations more difficult to coordinate.  Unfortunately, insurance 
loss estimates did not take into account damages occurring to the following 
season's crop.  Therefore, total economic losses were probably underestimated 
by the percentage of the next season's crop dropped, diseased or not set as a 
result of the previous seasons hail.

<font size=+1><b>Despite their rarity in Florida,</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif"> crop damages caused by hailstones in the 
United States historically have been enormous.  Prior to about 1960 
in fact, crop damages comprised about three-quarters of total U.S. hail 
losses.  As American society has evolved from agrarian to urban, however, 
greater hail losses today occur in metropolitan areas.  For example, a 1992 
hail storm in Orlando caused $60 million in damages and was ranked as that 
citys worst natural disaster, exceeding even the damage caused by Hurricane 
Donna in 1960.  Hurricanes, tornadoes, lightning and freezes command more 
dramatic attention, but worldwide - and to a few unfortunate citrus 
growers - hail ranks as one of the most dangerous and destructive of all 
severe weather phenomena.<br>

<img src="cispacer3.gif">Experts agree there are a handful of important horticultural,
 economic and practical reasons why citrus growers hedge and top their trees. 
 Primary reasons include allowing the proper distribution of sunlight in trees 
 and keeping drive middles open for equipment access.<br>
   
  
  
  <p align=Left>


  <img src="cispacer3.gif">But Charlie Russ knows there are other considerations
   as well - like aesthetics and psychology. He should know. His Orange 
   Service Co., one of Florida's oldest and largest hedgers and toppers, 
   prunes 115-130,000 acres of grove a year.
  
  
  
  <br>
  <p align=Left>


  <img src="cispacer3.gif">"They like the way it (hedging and topping) 
  looks," he said emphatically. He explained that Americans have been 
  taught "to like multiples of things in a uniform arrangement." He said 
  citrus growers like the neat, uniform look that hedging and topping gives 
  their trees. "It is a consideration in every person's decision-making process, 
  whether he'll admit it or not," Russ said.
  
  
    
  <br>
  <p align=Left>


  <img src="cispacer3.gif">Russ said most growers, generally considered 
  among the most practical of people, will look at a newly hedged grove 
  and say, "It looks pretty." A corporate chief executive officer who 
  doesn't know horticulture will visit a newly hedged grove and say the 
  exact same thing - "It looks pretty." 
  
  
    <br>
  <p align=Left>


  <img src="cispacer3.gif">Not that there's anything wrong with a pretty grove! 
  In fact, a proper hedging and topping maintenance program is a good 
  horticultural and economic practice, regardless of the motivation.
  
  
   
   
     <br>
  <p align=Left>


  <img src="cispacer3.gif">Russ added that even though aesthetics is 
  a consideration, it isn't the primary reason most growers hedge and top. 
  He believes that horticultural and economic considerations are the main 
  reasons most growers prune, and properly so. 
  
  
  
  <br>
   
      
      
 
      
      <p align=Left>

<font size=+1><b>HORTICULTURAL REASONS</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif">"The biggest reason (to hedge and top) is the entrapment
 of light," Russ said. "Growers hedge to address the foliage surface at various 
 positions in the tree to allow the inception of light."
 <br>


<br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">Every grower knows that sunlight is one of the 
key ingredients in tree growth. Proper hedging and topping allows sunlight
 to get to all parts of a tree's canopy, including the bottom. To let light
  get to the bottom, many growers hedge at an angle up to 10-15 degrees so 
  that the tree's bottom is wider than its top. Russ said a 10-12.5 degree 
  angle is popular in Florida and some growers go as high as 25 degrees. 
  Hedge a tree straight up and down, as was the practice many years ago, and 
  the bottom of the tree's canopy will actually die back from lack of sunlight, 
  Russ said.
  
  
  <br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">He said since hardly any light gets farther 
into a tree than three feet, growers want only two to three feet of 
foliage inside the hedger's cut on a mature tree.


<br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">Russ agrees with a University of Florida Institute 
of Food and Agricultural Sciences (IFAS) general formula regarding the ratio 
between a tree's height and the drive middle. That formula calls for the tree's 
height to be twice the width of the drive middle, measured at the bottom of the 
tree. If there's an eight-foot opening from tree canopy to tree canopy in 
the drive middle, the tree should be 16 feet tall. Russ said the formula is 
a good guide to help ensure that trees get proper doses of sunlight.



<br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">Another key horticultural consideration 
in hedging and topping is maintenance of a tree's proper shoot 
to root (or trunk to root) ratio. If either the root system or 
canopy of a tree is significantly larger than the other, the tree 
will suffer. Topping and hedging can both be used to keep the ratio 
in balance. Many flatwoods growers use topping to maintain that shoot 
to root ratio, since root systems are limited by shallow root zones.


<br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">Some growers hedge and top in an effort to control 
alternate bearing, a situation in which crops are heavy one year and light 
the next. Pruning after a light crop and before an expected heavy crop often 
helps reduce alternate bearing.


<br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">Some growers also hedge and top in an effort to 
rejuvenate groves in which tree canopies are overgrown or the shoot to 
root ratio is out of whack. Russ said in such situations, deep cuts are 
made into heavy wood and spurs juvenile growth.  Over a year or two, he said, 
the tree often recovers to a fully productive status. However, there is some 
controversy within the industry over the value of rejuvenative hedging, which 
makes up less than five percent of Russ' business.



<br>
      
      <p align=Left>



<img src="cispacer3.gif">The vast majority of growers practice annual 
or every-other-year hedging and topping maintenance programs that virtually 
all experts agree are beneficial. Consequently, the recommendations Russ makes
 here are primarily for maintenance programs.


<br><br><hr width=75%>
      
      <p align=Left>



<font size=+1><b>ECONOMIC AND PRACTICAL REASONS</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif">Russ said although it's not a widespread practice, 
some fresh fruit growers hedge to control the number of fruit on each tree. 
If they want large size fruit that might bring a better price next season, 
"they actually hedge to reduce the fruit bearing surface so that the fruit 
that's there will gain size." He said some growers of tangerines, Murcottes 
and tangelos hedge to cut off a third of their crop in May or June so the 
remaining fruit will grow larger.<br>


  <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Many growers use hedging to maintain enough drive 
middle width for sprayers and other grove equipment to pass between rows.<br>

  <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Hedging and topping both allow more efficient 
spray applications. Topping keeps trees at heights where sprayers are 
effective, and the reduced foliage left by hedging allows better spray 
penetration. Topping also keeps trees at a height where fruit is readily 
accessible for harvesters.<br>


<br><p align=Left>



<font size=+1><b>HOW OFTEN, AND WHEN?</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif">Most growers hedge annually to maintain the depth 
of foliage inside the cut at three feet. Depending on growth, however, some 
get by with hedging every other year and topping even less frequently.<br>


  <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Often, annual or biannual hedging simply cuts off 
8-12 inches of new growth that has appeared since the last hedging.<br>


 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">One advantage of an annual or biannual maintenance
 hedging and topping program is that the debris is so light it can simply 
 be left on the grove floor. Heavier hedging, such as that done for rejuvenation,
  drops heavy wood on the ground, and it is expensive to dispose of this debris.<br>
  
  
   <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">For all fruit varieties except Valencia oranges, 
most growers hedge after this year's crop is harvested and prior to the 
spring bloom. Russ recommends that growers not hedge later than two or 
three weeks after spring petal fall. "If you go more than three weeks after 
petal fall, you're going to remove (new) fruit you don't want to remove," 
he said. Because most prune after the crop is harvested, the biggest hedging
 and topping months are December through March, but many hedge right up to June.<br>
 
 
   <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Russ said there are two schools of thought on the 
hedging of Valencias, which carry both a new crop and a soon-to-be-harvested
 crop of fruit through the spring. He said many growers hedge shortly after 
 harvest, or as late as August. However, many others hedge prior to bloom, 
 usually from November to March. "The industry trend is toward pre-bloom. 
 I'm on the fence on this." <br>
 
 
    <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Experts recommend against doing heavy rejuvenation 
hedging or topping late in the fall or early in the winter because of cold 
considerations. Heavy pruning reduces protective canopy levels and spurs new
 growth that is very susceptible to cold weather. <br>
 
 
     <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">But Russ said there's no problem with maintenance 
hedging and topping in the fall because a relatively small amount of canopy 
is being removed. Maintenance pruning doesn't greatly reduce protective canopy
 or spur much growth. <br>
 
 
      <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Most growers start hedging when groves are about four 
years old, Russ said. They hedge then because the trees will generally overgrow
 their drive middles after five or six years. <br>
 
 
  <br><hr width=75%>
      
      <p align=Left>



<font size=+1><b>Charlie Russ<br>
citrus by choice</b></font><br>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Most citrus growers own a wide array of grove 
equipment and they or their employees do everything from mowing to spraying.
 But when it comes to hedging and topping their trees, virtually all go outside
  their own grove or company. <br>
  
  
     <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">"They opt, and I think wisely so, to use me or somebody 
else to do their work," said Charlie Russ, owner of Orange Service Co. 
Russ said hedging and topping requires sophisticated operators and maintenance,
 as well as some engineering expertise, to keep the big pruning machines running
  properly.<br>
  
  
      <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Although both large and small growers call for outside
 pruning help, larger growers are more likely to know exactly how they want the
  job done. Often, such growers have full-time production managers paid to make 
  such decisions.<br>
  
  
        <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Smaller, independent growers are more likely to want 
some advice. "We tend to make more recommendations there, and they tend to 
seek our input more," Russ said. He said smaller growers might say, "I want 
to do some trimming. I don't want to overcut it. What width would you recommend?"
Or they might ask his advice on a specific fruit variety they're having hedged and
 topped, like Murcottes and other mandarins. (Since Murcotte trees have been known
  to collapse under the weight of their fruit, some Murcotte owners have those trees
   hedged more drastically to reduce the fruit load. Some other mandarin varieties
    also tend to overcrop, and their owners likewise will use hedging and topping
     to reduce fruit loads.)<br>
     
     
      <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">When growers call on Russ, they're talking to a veteran 
hedger and topper who's also a fellow grower. Like many of his customers, 
he's experienced the ups and downs - including the devastating freezes of 
the 1980s - that go with growing citrus.<br>


   <br><p align=Left>



<font size=+1><b>CITRUS BY CHOICE</b></font><br>
<img src="cispacer3.gif">The 52-year-old Russ didn't come to citrus by birth. 
Although he was raised in Haines City, his only family citrus connection was 
his mother's job as office manager and assistant secretary-treasurer at Waverly
 Citrus Growers Association. "I got influenced by that," he recalled.<br>


  <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">As a teenager, Russ worked at Haines City Citrus Growers
 Association, hoeing groves and moving fruit by hand cart at the packing house. 
 Grower returns were good in those days, and Russ saw citrus growing as a possible
  career choice.<br>
  
  
    <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">After graduating from the University of Florida, 
where he majored in citrus production, Russ served in the military and 
worked as a fertilizer salesman. While still in his mid 20s, he became 
assistant production manager for large grove owner Libby in Lake County. 
He soon became a crop advisor or technical assistant with Libby, and got 
involved in corporate research projects on fertilizer, spray materials, 
herbicides and abscission chemicals. He also ventured into citrus growing 
by buying a five-acre grove in 1968. He would continue to add to his grove 
holdings over the next several years.<br>


 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Russ went to work with Citrus Systems in 1972-73, 
promoting mechanical harvesting in an effort to create a market for the 
company's abscission chemicals. Neither mechanical harvesting nor the 
abscission chemicals that might make it feasible caught on at that time.<br>


<br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">In his late 20s in 1969, Russ started a sideline citrus
 business removing blighted trees with front-end loaders. (At that time, he 
 recalled, blight was called sand hill decline.) In 1973 he added hedging to 
 his part-time business, and he went into hedging full time in February 1974. 
 Several years before, he had incorporated his business as Orange Service Co.<br>
 
 
 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Citrus production boomed in the northern edge of 
the citrus belt in the 1970s and Russ had eight hedgers and two toppers - all
 built in his Clermont shop ?by the early 1980s. Most of his hedging and 
 topping customers were in Lake, Orange and Polk counties.<br>
 
 
 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">When the December 1983 freeze walloped groves in 
those three counties, it also walloped Russ. "1983 was a real setback," 
he recalled. After the January 1985 freeze just 13 months later, "we'd 
lost 87-89 percent of our customers in the north area."<br>


 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">In 1986, Russ opened an Orange Service Co. shop in Fort
 Pierce to provide hedging and topping for the expanding southern citrus belt. 
 He opened another shop in Arcadia in 1988. His expansion to the south may have 
 saved his company. By the time the Christmas 1989 freeze was over, 97 percent 
 of his northern citrus belt customers had succumbed to the killer freezes of 
 the 1980s. During most of the 1980s and the early 1990s, Orange Service Co. 
 worked at only 50-60 percent of its capacity. "It was very difficult for us."<br>
 
 
 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">The 1980s were also difficult to Russ, the grower. 
He had accumulated 300 acres of orange groves by 1981, and the 1980s 
freezes chipped away at his groves. The 1989 freeze killed all of his 
trees. He replanted 50 acres in Clermont in 1991, leaving him with 
one-sixth the citrus acreage he once owned.<br>


 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Orange Service's original Clermont shop now serves 
primarily as the company's manufacturing and engineering shop. Most of the 
hedging and topping services are provided out of the Arcadia and Fort Pierce 
facilities.<br>


 <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Orange Service builds its own hedgers and toppers in
 the Clermont shop. Over the years, the shop has also built  sprayers, 
 1,000-gallon water supply trucks for spraying operations and furrow 
 shapers and vee mowers for bedded groves. It still sells the furrow shapers
  and mowers to growers.<br>
  
  
  <br><p align=Left>




<img src="cispacer3.gif">Today, Orange Service Co. has seven hedgers, four toppers 
and a skirter that it uses to prune groves all over the citrus belt. Russ said 
the company spends about $25,000 a year on in-house research that might improve 
hedging and topping procedures. Like the citrus business, Russ said, the research 
efforts have had varying results. "Some pay off and some don't."<br>

<H2><B>a. Risk Factors</B></H2>
<P><HR WIDTH = 100% ALIGN=CENTER SIZE=2><BR>

<P>
<H4><U><B>Risk Factors</U></B></H4>
<P>
<P><U><B>Key Risk Factors:</U></B><BR>

<P><B>	The most proven and significant risk factors are being female and getting older.</B>  <U>75% of the women with breast cancer have no known risk factors.</U>			<BR>

<P>	*	A <B>personal history</B> of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer can also increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.<BR>

<P>	*	A <B>family history</B> of breast, colon, ovarian, or endometrial cancer may prove to be a risk factor for some women.  <U>Only 5-10% of breast cancers are due to what one inherits (family history).</U><BR>

<P><U><B>Other Considerations:</U></B><BR>

<P>	<B>Radiation exposure</B><BR>
<B>	</B>Mammograms, dental or chest x-rays have not been proven to be risk factors for breast cancer.  Improved equipment and film have minimized x-ray exposure.  American College of Radiology (ACR) accreditation requires there be no more than 1 rad of radiation exposure per breast per mammogram.  During a year's time one receives more natural radiation exposure from the environment than from a mammogram.<BR>

<P><B>	Age at Menarche (when period begins) and Menopause</B><BR>
	There seems to be a slight increase in risk if a woman begins her period early (before age 12) and/or has a late onset of menopause (after age 55).  The risk appears to be related to the number of years a woman is exposed to monthly hormonal changes.  However, this factor is only a very slight increase.<BR>

<P><B>	Age at First Pregnancy/Having no children</B><BR>
	There does seem to be a correlation between the age of a woman at her first pregnancy and the risk of developing breast cancer.  The younger a woman is at the time of her first pregnancy (age 20 or younger), the lower the risk of breast cancer.  Also, there is a slight increased risk for women who do not have children.  Again, this is a small factor in determining an individuals overall risk.<BR>

<P><B>	Mild to Moderate Alcohol Consumption</B><BR>
	Studies have consistently found that moderate alcohol consumption (3 or more drinks/week) increase a womans risk of developing breast cancer.  More data needs to be collected on this issue.<BR>

<P><B>	Oral Contraceptives</B><BR>
	Studies indicate that oral contraceptives do not increase the risk of breast cancer in women over 45 years of age.  More recent studies have shown an increase in breast cancer risk for women under 45 who take birth control pills.  Further studies are needed to help clarify the relationship between oral contraceptives and breast cancer risk.<BR>

<P><B>	Replacement Hormones</B><BR>
	There have been conflicting studies on linking hormone replacement therapy and an increased risk in breast cancer.  At this time, there is <U>not</U> a link that suggests that HRT <I>causes</I> breast cancer. However, some tumors are sensitive to hormones, and the hormones stimulate their growth. In these cases, the hormones would cause the tumors to grow faster.  <BR>

<P>	Hormone replacement therapy has been proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation recommends each woman thoroughly discuss the question of hormone replacement therapy with her doctor.<BR>

<P><B>	Smoking</B><BR>
	No clear association between cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk has been established.<BR>

<P><B>	Abortion</B><BR>
	There have been several studies on both sides of this issue, but there is no conclusive evidence to link abortion, either natural or induced, with an increased risk of breast cancer.<BR>

<P>	<B>Diet  </B><BR>
<B>	</B>Although research on heart disease and colon cancer has shown dietary associations, current research linking breast cancer and diet is not conclusive.  Initial findings do suggest an association between breast cancer risk and a high fat, low fiber diet, however additional studies need to be done to further substantiate these findings.<BR>

DEBBY'S DEBUT</center></h1> <p>



<p>



 <p><center><font size=4>by Louisa May Alcott</font></center>

<p><img src="../../../images/transp.gif" alt="" vspace=10><p>



<p>



<blockquote>



<p>



<p><br><p><br>



<font size=5>O</font><font size=3>n a cheery June day Mrs. Penelope Carroll and her niece Debby Wilder were

whizzing along on their way to a certain gay watering-place, both in the best

of humors with each other and all the world beside. Aunt Pen was concocting

sundry mild romances, and laying harmless plots for the pursuance of her

favorite pastime, match-making; for she had invited her pretty relative to join

her summer jaunt, ostensibly that the girl might see a little of fashionable

life, but the good lady secretly proposed to herself to take her to the beach

and get her a rich husband, very much as she would have proposed to take her to

Broadway and get her a new bonnet, for both articles she considered necessary,

but somewhat difficult for a poor girl to obtain.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby was slowly getting her poise, after the excitement of a first visit to

New York; for ten days of bustle had introduced the young philosopher to a new

existence, and the working-day world seemed to have vanished when she made her

last pat of butter in the dairy at home. For an hour she sat thinking over the

good-fortune which had befallen her, and the comforts of this life which she

had suddenly acquired. Debby was a true girl,--with all a girl's love of ease

and pleasure; and it must not be set down against her that she surveyed her

pretty travelling-suit with much complacency, rejoicing inwardly that she could

use her hands without exposing fractured gloves, that her bonnet was of the

newest mode, needing no veil to hide a faded ribbon or a last year's shape,

that her dress swept the ground with fashionable untidiness, and her boots were

guiltless of a patch,--that she was the possessor of a mine of wealth in two of

the eight trunks belonging to her aunt, that she was travelling like any lady

of the land with man-and maid-servant at her command, and that she was leaving

work and care behind her for a month or two of novelty and rest.<p>



<p>



<p>



When these agreeable facts were fully realized, and Aunt Pen had fallen asleep

behind her veil, Debby took out a book, and indulged in her favorite luxury,

soon forgetting past, present, and future in the inimitable history of Martin

Chuzzlewit. The sun blazed, the cars rattled, children cried, ladies nodded,

gentlemen longed for the solace of prohibited cigars, and newspapers were

converted into sun-shades, nightcaps, and fans; but Debby read on, unconscious

of all about her, even of the pair of eyes that watched her from the opposite

corner of the car. A gentleman with a frank, strong-featured face sat therein,

and amused himself by scanning with thoughtful gaze the countenances of his

fellow-travellers. Stout Aunt Pen, dignified even in her sleep, was a "model of

deportment" to the rising generation; but the student of human nature found a

more attractive subject in her companion, the girl with an apple-blossom face

and merry brown eyes, who sat smiling into her book, never heeding that her

bonnet was awry, and the wind taking unwarrantable liberties with her ribbons

and her hair.<p>



<p>



<p>



Innocent Debby turned her pages, unaware that her fate sat opposite in the

likeness of a serious, black-bearded gentleman, who watched the smiles rippling

from her lips to her eyes with an interest that deepened as the minutes passed.

If his paper had been full of anything but "Bronchial Troches" and "Spalding's

Prepared Glue," he would have found more profitable employment; but it wasn't,

and with the usual readiness of idle souls he fell into evil ways, and

permitted curiosity, that feminine sin, to enter in and take possession of his

manly mind. A great desire seized him to discover what book so interested his

pretty neighbor; but a cover hid the name, and he was too distant to catch it

on the fluttering leaves. Presently a stout Emerald-Islander, with her wardrobe

oozing out of sundry paper parcels, vacated the seat behind the two ladies; and

it was soon quietly occupied by the individual for whom Satan was finding such

indecorous employment. Peeping round the little gray bonnet, past a brown braid

and a fresh cheek, the young man's eye fell upon the words the girl was

reading, and forgot to look away again. Books were the desire of his life; but

an honorable purpose and an indomitable will kept him steady at his ledgers

till he could feel that he had earned the right to read. Like wine to many

another was an open page to him; he read a line, and, longing for more, took a

hasty sip from his neighbor's cup, forgetting that it was a stranger's also.<p>



<p>

Down the page went the two pairs of eyes, and the merriment from Debby's seemed

to light up the sombre ones behind her with a sudden shine that softened the

whole face and made it very winning. No wonder they twinkled, for Elijah Pogram

spoke, and "Mrs. Hominy, the mother of the modern Gracchi, in the classical

blue cap and the red cotton picket-handkerchief, came down the room in a

procession of one." A low laugh startled Debby, though it was smothered like

the babes in the Tower; and, turning, she beheld the trespasser scarlet with

confusion, and sobered with a tardy sense of his transgression. Debby was not a

starched young lady of the "prune and prism" school, but a frank, free-hearted

little body, quick to read the sincerity of others, and to take looks and words

at their real value. Dickens was her idol; and for his sake she could have

forgiven a greater offense than this. The stranger's contrite countenance and

respectful apology won her good-will at once; and with a finer courtesy than

any Aunt Pen would have taught, she smilingly bowed her pardon, and taking

another book from her basket, opened it, saying, pleasantly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Here is the first volume, if you like it, Sir. I can recommend it as an

invaluable consolation for the discomforts of a summer day's journey, and it is

heartily at your service."<p>



<p>



<p>



As much surprised as gratified, the gentleman accepted the book, and retired

behind it with the sudden discovery that wrong-doing has its compensation in

the pleasurable sensation of being forgiven. Stolen delights are well known to

be specially saccharine; and much as this pardoned sinner loved books, it

seemed to him that the interest of the story flagged, and that the enjoyment of

reading was much enhanced by the proximity of a gray bonnet and a girlish

profile. But Dickens soon proved more powerful than Debby, and she was

forgotten, till, pausing to turn a leaf, the young man met her shy glance, as

she asked, with the pleased expression of a child who has shared an apple with

a playmate,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Is it good?"<p>



<p>



"Oh, very!"--and the man looked as honestly grateful for the book as the boy

would have done for the apple.<p>



<p>



<p>



Only five words in the conversation, but Aunt Pen woke, as if the watchful

spirit of propriety had roused her to pluck her charge from the precipice on

which she stood.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Dora, I'm astonished at you! Speaking to strangers in that free manner is a

most unladylike thing. How came you to forget what I have told you over and

over again about a proper reserve?"<p>



<p>



<p>



The energetic whisper reached the gentleman's ear, and he expected to be

annihilated with a look when his offense was revealed; but he was spared that

ordeal, for the young voice answered, softly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Don't faint, Aunt Pen; I only did as I'd be done by; for I had two books, and

the poor man looked so hungry for something to read that I couldn't resist

sharing my 'goodies.' He will see that I'm a countrified little thing in spite

of my fine feathers, and won't be shocked at my want of rigidity and frigidity;

so don't look dismal, and I'll be prim and proper all the rest of the way,--if

I don't forget it."<p>



<p>



<p>



"I wonder who he is; may belong to some of our first families, and in that case

it might be worth while to exert ourselves, you know. Did you learn his name,

Dora?" whispered the elder lady.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby shook her head, and murmured, "Hush!"--but Aunt Pen had heard of matches

being made in cars as well as in heaven; and as an experienced general, it

became her to reconnoitre, when one of the enemy approached her camp. Slightly

altering her position, she darted an all-comprehensive glance at the invader,

who seemed entirely absorbed, for not an eyelash stirred during the scrutiny.

It lasted but an instant, yet in that instant he was weighed and found wanting;

for that experienced eye detected that his cravat was two inches wider than

fashion ordained, that his coat was not of the latest style, that his gloves

were mended, and his handkerchief neither cambric nor silk. That was enough,

and sentence was passed forthwith,--"Some respectable clerk, good-looking, but

poor, and not at all the thing for Dora"; and Aunt Pen turned to adjust a

voluminous green veil over her niece's bonnet, "To shield it from the dust,

dear," which process also shielded the face within from the eye of man.<p>



<p>



<p>



A curious smile, half mirthful, half melancholy, passed over their neighbor's

lips; but his peace of mind seemed undisturbed, and he remained buried in his

book till they reached --------, at dusk. As he returned it, he offered his

services in procuring a carriage or attending to luggage; but Mrs. Carroll,

with much dignity of aspect, informed him that her servants would attend to

those matters, and, bowing gravely, he vanished into the night.<p>



<p>



<p>



As they rolled away to the hotel, Debby was wild to run down to the beach

whence came the solemn music of the sea, making the twilight beautiful. But

Aunt Pen was too tired to do anything but sup in her own apartment and go early

to bed; and Debby might as soon have proposed to walk up the Great Pyramid as

to make her first appearance without that sage matron to mount guard over her;

so she resigned herself to pie and patience, and fell asleep, wishing it were

to-morrow.<p>



<p>



<p>



At five, A.M., a nightcapped head appeared at one of the myriad windows of the

------- Hotel, and remained there as if fascinated by the miracle of sunrise

over the sea. Under her simplicity of character and girlish merriment Debby

possessed a devout spirit and a nature full of the real poetry of life, two

gifts that gave her dawning womanhood its sweetest charm, and made her what she

was. As she looked out that summer dawn upon the royal marriage of the ocean

and the sun, all petty hopes and longings faded out of sight, and her young

face grew luminous with thoughts too deep for words. Her day was happier for

that silent hour, her life richer for the aspirations that uplifted her like

beautiful strong angels, and left a blessing when they went. The smile of the

June sky touched her lips, the morning red seemed to linger on her cheek, and

in her eye arose a light kindled by the shimmer of that broad sea of gold; for

Nature rewarded her young votary well, and gave her beauty, when she offered

love. How long she leaned there Debby did not know; steps from below roused her

from her reverie, and led her back into the world again. Smiling at herself,

she stole to bed, and lay wrapped in waking dreams as changeful as the shadows

dancing on her chamber-wall.<p>



<p>



<p>



The advent of her aunt's maid, Victorine, some two hours later, was the signal

to be "up and doing"; and she meekly resigned herself into the hands of that

functionary, who appeared to regard her in the light of an animated

pin-cushion, as she performed the toilet-ceremonies with an absorbed aspect,

which impressed her subject with a sense of the solemnity of the occasion.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Now, Mademoiselle, regard yourself, and pronounce that you are ravishing,"

Victorine said at length, folding her hands with a sigh of satisfaction, as she

fell back in an attitude of serene triumph. <p>



<p>



<p>



Debby obeyed, and inspected herself with great interest and some astonishment;

for there was a sweeping amplitude of array about the young lady whom she

beheld in the much-befrilled gown and embroidered skirts, which somewhat

alarmed her as to the navigation of a vessel "with such a spread of sail,"

while a curious sensation of being somebody else pervaded her from the crown of

her head, with its shining coils of hair, to the soles of the French slippers,

whose energies seemed to have been devoted to the production of marvellous

rosettes.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Yes, I look very nice, thank you; and yet I fell like a doll, helpless and

fine, and fancy I was more of a woman in my fresh gingham, with a knot of

clovers in my hair, than I am now. Aunt Pen was very kind to get me all these

pretty things; but I'm afraid my mother would look horrified to see me in such

a high state of flounce externally and so little room to breathe internally."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Your mamma would not flatter me, Mademoiselle; but come now to Madame; she is

waiting to behold you, and I have yet her toilet to make"; and, with a pitying

shrug, Victorine followed Debby to her aunt's room.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Charming! really elegant!" cried that lady, emerging from her towel with a

rubicund visage. "Drop that braid half an inch lower, and pull the worked end

of her handkerchief out of the right-hand pocket, Vic. There! Now, Dora, don't

run about and get rumpled, but sit quietly down and practice repose till I am

ready."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby obeyed, and sat mute, with the air of child in its Sunday-best on a

week-day, pleased with the novelty, but somewhat oppressed with the

responsibility of such unaccustomed splendor, and utterly unable to connect any

ideas of repose with tight shoes and skirts in a rampant state of starch.<p>



<p>



"Well, you see, I bet on Lady Gay against Cockadoodle, and if you'll believe me

------- Hullo! there's Mrs. Carroll, and deuse take me if she hasn't got a girl

with her! Look, Seguin!"--and Joe Leavenworth, a "man of the world," aged

twenty, paused in his account of an exciting race to make the announcement.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Seguin, his friend and Mentor, as much his senior in worldly wickedness as

in years, tore himself from his breakfast long enough to survey the newcomers,

and then returned to it, saying, briefly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"The old lady is worth cultivating,--gives good suppers, and thanks you for

eating them. The girl is well got up, but has no style, and blushes like a

milkmaid. Better fight shy of her, Joe."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Do you think so? Well, now I rather fancy that kind of thing. She's new, you

see, and I get on with that sort of girl the best, for the old ones are so

deused knowing that a fellow has no chance of a ------- By the Lord Harry,

she's eating bread and milk!"<p>



<p>



<p>



Young Leavenworth whisked his glass into his eye, and Mr. Seguin put down his

roll to behold the phenomenon. Poor Debby! her first step had been a wrong one.

<p>



<p>



<p>



All great minds have their weak points. Aunt Pen's was her breakfast, and the

peace of her entire day depended upon the success of that meal. Therefore being

down rather late, the worthy lady concentrated her energies upon the

achievement of a copious repast, and, trusting to former lessons, left Debby to

her own resources for a few fatal moments. After the flutter occasioned by

being scooped into her seat by a severe-nosed waiter, Debby had only courage

enough left to refuse tea and coffee and accept milk. That being done, she took

the first familiar viand that appeared, and congratulated herself upon being

able to get her usual breakfast. With returning composure, she looked about her

and began to enjoy the buzz of voices, the clatter of knives and forks, and the

long lines of faces all intent upon the business of the hour; but her peace was

of short duration. Pausing for a fresh relay of toast, Aunt Pen glanced toward

her niece with the comfortable conviction that her appearance was highly

creditable; and her dismay can be imagined, when she beheld that young lady

placidly devouring a great cup of brown-bread and milk before the eyes of the

assembled multitude. The poor lady choked in her coffee, and between her gasps

whispered irefully behind her napkin,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"For Heaven's sake, Dora put away that mess! The Ellenboroughs are directly

opposite, watching everything you do. Eat that omelet, or anything respectable,

unless you want me to die of mortification."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby dropped her spoon, and, hastily helping herself from the dish her aunt

pushed toward her, consumed the leathery compound with as much grace as she

could assume, though unable to repress a laugh at Aunt Pen's disturbed

countenance. There was a slight lull in the clatter, and the blithe sound

caused several heads to turn toward the quarter whence it came, for it was as

unexpected and pleasant a sound as a bobolink's song in a cage of shrill-voiced

canaries.<p>



<p>



<p>



"She's a jolly little thing and powerful pretty, so deuse take me if I don't

make up to the old lady and find out who the girl is. I've been introduced to

Mrs. Carroll at our house; but I suppose she won't remember me till I remind

her."<p>



<p>



<p>



The "deuse" declining to accept of his repeated offers, (probably because there

was still too much honor and honesty in the boy,) young Leavenworth sought out

Mrs. Carroll on the piazza, as she and Debby were strolling there an hour

later.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Joe Leavenworth, my dear, from one of our first families,--very wealthy,--fine

match,--pray, be civil,--smooth your hair, hold back your shoulders, and put

down your parasol," murmured Aunt Pen, as the gentleman approached with as much

pleasure in his countenance as it was consistent with manly dignity to express

upon meeting two of the inferior race.<p>



<p>



<p>



"My niece, Miss Dora Wilder. This is her first season at the beach, and we must

endeavor to make it pleasant for her, or she will be getting homesick and

running away to mamma," said Aunt Pen, in her society-tone, after she had

returned his greeting, and perpetrated a polite fiction, by declaring that she

remembered him perfectly, for he was the image of his father.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Leavenworth brought the heels of his varnished boots together with a click,

and executed the latest bow imported, then stuck his glass in his eye and

stared till it fell out, (the glass, not the eye,) upon which he fell into step

with them, remarking,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I shall be most happy to show the lions: they are deused tame ones, so you

needn't be alarmed, Miss Wilder."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby was good-natured enough to laugh; and, elated with that success, he

proceeded to pour forth his stores of wit and learning in true collegian style,

quite unconscious that the "jolly little thing" was looking him through and

through with the smiling eyes that were producing such pleasurable sensations

under the mosaic studs. They strolled toward the beach, and, meeting an old

acquaintance, Aunt Pen fell behind, and beamed upon the young pair as if her

prophetic eye even at this early stage beheld them walking altarward in a

proper state of blond white vest and bridal awkwardness.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Can you skip a stone, Mr. Leavenworth?" asked Debby, possessed with a

mischievous desire to shock the piece of elegance at her side.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Eh? what's that?" he inquired, with his head on one side, like an inquisitive

robin.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby repeated her question, and illustrated it by sending a stone skimming

over the water in the most scientific manner. Mr. Joe was painfully aware that

this was not at all "the thing," that his sisters never did so, and that Seguin

would laugh confoundedly, if he caught him at it; but Debby looked so

irresistibly fresh and pretty under her rose-lined parasol that he was moved to

confess that he had done such a thing, and to sacrifice his gloves by poking in

the sand, that he might indulge in a like unfashionable pastime.<p>



<p>



<p>



"You'll be at the hop to-night, I hope, Miss Wilder," he observed, introducing

a topic suited to a young lady's mental capacity.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Yes, indeed; for dancing is one of the joys of my life, next to husking and

making hay"; and Debby polked a few steps along the beach , much to the

edification of a pair of old gentlemen, serenely taking their first

"constitutional."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Making what?" cried Mr. Joe, polking after her.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Hay; ah, that is the pleasantest fun in the world,--and better exercise, my

mother says, for soul and body, than dancing till dawn in crowded rooms, with

everything in a state of unnatural excitement. If one wants real merriment, let

him go into a new-mown field, where all the air is full of summer odors, where

wild-flowers nod along the walls, where blackbirds make finer music than any

band, and sun and wind and cheery voices do their part, while windrows rise,

and great loads go rumbling through the lanes with merry brown faces atop. Yes,

much as I like dancing, it is not to be compared with that; for in the one case

we shut out the lovely world, and in the other we become a part of it, till by

its magic labor turns to poetry, and we harvest something better than dried

buttercups and grass."<p>



<p>



<p>



As she spoke, Debby looked up, expecting to meet a glance of disapproval; but

something in the simple earnestness of her manner had recalled certain boyish

pleasures as innocent as they were hearty, which now contrasted very favorably

with the later pastimes in which fast horses, and that lower class of animals,

fast men, bore so large a part. Mr. Joe thoughtfully punched five holes in the

sand, and for a moment Debby liked the expression of his face; then the old

listlessness returned, and, looking up, he said, with an air of ennui that was

half sad, half ludicrous, in one so young and so generously endowed with youth,

health, and the good gifts of this life,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I used to fancy that sort of thing years ago, but I'm afraid I should find it

a little slow now, though you describe it in such an inviting manner that I

should be tempted to try it, if a hay-cock came in my way; for, upon my life,

it's deused heavy work loafing about at these watering-places all summer.

Between ourselves, there's a deal of humbug about this kind of life, as you

will find, when you've tried it as long as I have."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Yes, I begin to think so already; but perhaps you can give me a few friendly

words of warning from the stores of your experience, that I may be spared the

pain of saying what so many look,--'Grandma, the world is hollow; my doll is

stuffed with sawdust; and I should like to go into a convent, if you

please.'"<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby's eyes were dancing with merriment; but they were demurely downcast, and

her voice was perfectly serious. <p>



<p>



<p>



The milk of human kindness had been slightly curdled for Mr. Joe by sundry

College-tribulations; and having been "suspended," he very naturally vibrated

between the inborn jollity of his temperament and the bitterness occasioned by

his wrongs. He had lost at billiards the night before, had been hurried at

breakfast, had mislaid his cigar-case, and splashed his boots; consequently the

darker mood prevailed that morning, and when his counsel was asked, he gave it

like one who had known the heaviest trials of this "Piljin Projiss of a

wale."<p>



<p>



<p>



"There's no justice in the world, no chance for us young people to enjoy

ourselves, without some penalty to pay, some drawback to worry us like these

confounded 'all-rounders.' Even here, where all seems free and easy, there's no

end of gossips and spies who tattle and watch till you feel as if you lived in

a lantern. 'Every one for himself, and the Devil take the hindmost': that's the

principle they go on, and you have to keep your wits about you in the most

exhausting manner, or you are done for before you know it. I've seen a good

deal of this sort of thing, and hope you'll get on better than some do, when

it's known that you are the rich Mrs. Carroll's niece; though you don't need

that fact to enhance your charms,--upon my life, you don't."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby laughed behind her parasol at this burst of candor; but her independent

nature prompted her to make a fair beginning, in spite of Aunt Pen's polite

fictions and well-meant plans.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Thank you for your warning, but I don't apprehend much annoyance of that

kind," she said, demurely. "Do you know, I think, if young ladies were

truthfully labelled when they went into society, it would be a charming fashion

and save a world of trouble? Something in this style:--'Arabella Marabout, aged

nineteen, fortune $100,000, temper warranted'; 'Laura Eau-de-Cologne, aged

twenty-eight, fortune $30,000, temper slightly damaged'; 'Deborah Wilder, aged

eighteen, fortune, one pair of hands, one head, indifferently well filled, one

heart, (not in the market,) temper decided, and no expectations.' There, you

see, that would do away with much of the humbug you lament, and we poor souls

would know at once whether we were sought for our fortunes or ourselves, and

that would be so comfortable!"<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Leavenworth turned away, with a convicted sort of expression, as she spoke,

and, making a spyglass of his hand, seemed to be watching something out at sea

with absorbing interest. He had been guilty of a strong desire to discover

whether Debby was an heiress, but had not expected to be so entirely satisfied

on that important subject, and was dimly conscious that a keen eye had seen his

anxiety, and a quick wit devised a means of setting it at rest forever.

Somewhat disconcerted, he suddenly changed the conversation, and, like many

another distressed creature, took to the water, saying briskly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"By-the-by, Miss Wilder, as I've engaged to do the honors, shall I have the

pleasure of bathing with you when the fun begins? As you are fond of

hay-making, I suppose you intend to pay your respects to the old gentleman with

the three-pronged pitchfork?"<p>



<p>



<p>



"Yes, Aunt Pen means to put me through a course of salt water, and any

instructions in the art of navigation will be gratefully received; for I never

saw the ocean before, and labor under a firm conviction, that, once in, I never

shall come out again till I am brought, like Mr. Mantilini, a 'damp, moist,

unpleasant body.'"<p>



<p>



<p>



As Debby spoke, Mrs. Carroll hove in sight, coming down before the wind with

all sails set, and signals of distress visible long before she dropped anchor

and came along-side. The devoted woman had been strolling slowly for the girl's

sake, though oppressed with a mournful certainty that her most prominent

feature was fast becoming a fine copper-color; yet she had sustained herself

like a Spartan matron, till it suddenly occurred to her that her charge might

be suffering a like<p>



<p>





"Sea-change<p>



<p>



         Into something rich and strange."<p>



<p>



<p>



Her fears, however, were groundless, for Debby met her without a freckle,

looking all the better for her walk; and though her feet were wet with chasing

the waves, and her pretty gown the worse for salt water, Aunt Pen never chid

her for the destruction of her raiment, nor uttered a warning word against an

unladylike exuberance of spirits, but replied to her inquiry most

graciously,--<p>



<p>



"Certainly, my love, we shall bathe at eleven, and there will be just time to

get Victorine and our dresses; so run on to the house, and I will join you as

soon as I have finished what I am saying to Mrs. Earle,"--then added, in a

stage-aside, as she put a fallen lock off the girl's forehead, "You are doing

beautifully! He is evidently struck; make yourself interesting, and don't burn

your nose, I beg of you."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby's bright face clouded over, and she walked on with so much stateliness

that her escort wondered "what the deuse the old lady had done to her," and

exerted himself to the utmost to recall her merry mood, but with indifferent

success.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



"Now I begin to feel more like myself, for this is getting back to first

principles, though I fancy I look like the little old woman who fell asleep on

the king's highway and woke up with abbreviated drapery; and you look funnier

still, Aunt Pen," said Debby, as she tied on her pagoda-hat, and followed Mrs.

Carroll, who walked out of her dressing-room an animated bale of blue cloth

surmounted by a gigantic sun-bonnet.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Leavenworth was in waiting, and so like a blond-headed lobster in his

scarlet suit that Debby could hardly keep her countenance as they joined the

groups of bathers gathering along the breezy shore.<p>



<p>



<p>



For an hour each day the actors and actresses who played their different roles

at the -------- Hotel with such precision and success put off their masks and

dared to be themselves. The ocean wrought the change, for it took old and young

into its arms, and for a little while they played like children in their

mother's lap. No falsehood could withstand its rough sincerity; for the waves

washed paint and powder from worn faces, and left a fresh bloom there. No

ailment could entirely resist its vigorous cure; for every wind brought healing

on its wings, endowing many a meagre life with another year of health. No

gloomy spirit could refuse to listen to its lullaby, and the spray baptized it

with the subtile benediction of a cheerier mood. No rank held place there; for

the democratic sea toppled down the greatest statesman in the land, and dashed

over the bald pate of a millionnaire with the same white-crested wave that

stranded a poor parson on the beach and filled a fierce reformer's mouth with

brine. No fashion ruled, but that which is as old as Eden,--the beautiful

fashion  of simplicity. Belles dropped their affectations with their hoops, and

ran about the shore blithe-hearted girls again. Young men forgot their vices

and their follies, and were not ashamed of the real courage, strength, and

skill they had tried to leave behind them with their boyish plays. Old men

gathered shells with the little Cupids dancing on the sand, and were better for

that innocent companionship; and young mothers never looked so beautiful as

when they rocked their babies on the bosom of the sea.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby vaguely felt this charm, and, yielding to it, splashed and sang like any

beach-bird, while Aunt Pen bobbed placidly up and down in a retired corner, and

Mr. Leavenworth swam to and fro, expressing his firm belief in mermaids,

sirens, and the rest of the aquatic sisterhood, whose warbling no manly ear can

resist.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Miss Wilder, you must learn to swim. I've taught quantities of young ladies,

and shall be delighted to launch the 'Dora,' if you'll accept me as a pilot.

Stop a bit; I'll get a life-preserver"; and leaving Debby to flirt with the

waves, the scarlet youth departed like a flame of fire.<p>



<p>



<p>



A dismal shriek interrupted his pupil's play, and looking up, she saw her aunt

beckoning wildly with one hand, while she was groping in the water with the

other. Debby ran to her, alarmed at her tragic expression, and Mrs. Carroll,

drawing the girl's face into the privacy of her big bonnet, whispered one awful

word, adding, distractedly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Dive for them! oh, dive for them! I shall be perfectly helpless, if they are

lost!"<p>



<p>



<p>



"I can't dive, Aunt Pen; but there is a man, let us ask him," said Debby, as a

black head appeared to windward.<p>



<p>



<p>



But Mrs. Carroll's "nerves" had received a shock, and gathering up her dripping

garments, she fled precipitately along the shore and vanished into her

dressing-room.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby's keen sense of the ludicrous got the better of her respect, and peal

after peal of laughter broke from her lips, till a splash behind her put an end

to her merriment, and, turning, she found that this friend in need was her

acquaintance of the day before. The gentleman seemed pausing for permission to

approach, with much the appearance of a sagacious Newfoundland, wistful and

wet.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Oh, I'm very glad it's you, Sir!" was Debby's cordial greeting, as she shook a

drop off the end of her nose, and nodded, smiling.<p>



<p>



<p>



The new comer immediately beamed upon her like an amiable Triton, saying as

they turned shoreward,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Our first interview opened with a laugh on my side, and our second with one on

yours. I accept the fact as a good omen. Your friend seemed in trouble; allow

me to atone for my past misdemeanors by offering my services now. But first let

me introduce myself; and as I believe in the fitness of things, let me present

you with an appropriate card"; and, stooping, the young man wrote "Frank Evan"

on the hard sand at Debby's feet.<p>



<p>



<p>



The girl liked his manner, and, entering into the spirit of the thing, swept as

grand a curtsy as her limited drapery would allow, saying, merrily,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I am Debby Wilder, or Dora, as aunt prefers to call me; and instead of

laughing, I ought be four feet under water, looking for something we have lost;

but I can't dive, and my distress is dreadful as you see."<p>



<p>



<p>



"What have you lost? I will look for it, and bring it back in spite of the

kelpies, if it is a human possibility," replied Mr. Evan, pushing his wet locks

out of his eyes, and regarding the ocean with a determined aspect.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby leaned toward him, whispering with solemn countenance,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"It is a set of teeth, Sir."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Evan was more a man of deeds than words, therefore he disappeared at once

with a mighty splash, and after repeated divings and much laughter appeared

bearing the chief ornament of Mrs. Penelope Carroll's comely countenance. Debby

looked very pretty and grateful as she returned her thanks, and Mr. Evan was

guilty of a secret wish that all the worthy lady's features were at the bottom

of the sea, that he might have the satisfaction of restoring them to her

attractive niece; but curbing this unnatural desire, he bowed, saying,

gravely,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Tell your aunt, if you please, that this little accident will remain a dead

secret, so far as I am concerned, and I am very glad to have been of service at

such a critical moment."<p>



<p>



<p>



Whereupon Mr. Evan marched again into the briny deep, and Debby trotted away to

her aunt, whom she found a clammy heap of blue flannel and despair. Mrs.

Carroll's temper was ruffled, and though she joyfully rattled in her teeth, she

said, somewhat testily, when Debby's story was done,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Now that man will have a sort of claim on us, and we must be civil, whoever he

is. Dear! dear! I wish it had been Joe Leavenworth instead. Evan--I don't

remember any of our first families with connections of that name, and I dislike

to be under obligations to a person of that sort, for there's no knowing how

far he may presume; so, pray, be careful, Dora."<p>



<p>



<p>



"I think you are very ungrateful, Aunt Pen; and if Mr. Evan should happen to be

poor, it does not become me to turn up my nose at him, for I'm nothing but a

make-believe myself just now. I don't wish to go down upon my knees to him, but

I do intend to be as kind to him as I should to that conceited Leavenworth boy;

yes, kinder even; for poor people value such things more, as I know very

well."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll instantly recovered her temper, changed the subject, and privately

resolved to confine her prejudices to her own bosom, as they seemed to have an

aggravating effect upon the youthful person whom she had set her heart on

disposing of to the best advantage.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby took her swimming-lesson with much success, and would have achieved her

dinner with composure, if white-aproned gentleman had not effectually taken

away her appetite by whisking bills-of-fare into her hands, and awaiting her

orders with a fatherly interest, which induced them to congregate mysterious

dishes before her, and blandly rectify her frequent mistakes. She survived the

ordeal, however, and at four P.M. went to drive with "that Leavenworth boy" in

the finest turnout ------- could produce. Aunt Pen then came off guard, and

with a sigh of satisfaction subsided into a peaceful doze, still murmuring,

even in her sleep,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Propinquity, my love, propinquity works wonders."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



"Aunt Pen, are you a modest woman?" asked the young crusader against

established absurdities, as she came into the presence-chamber that evening

ready for the hop.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Bless the child, what does she mean?" cried Mrs. Carroll, with a start that

twitched her back-hair out of Victorine's hands.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Would you like to have a daughter of yours go to a party looking as I look?"

continued her niece, spreading her airy dress, and standing very erect before

her astonished relative.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Why, of course I should, and be proud to own such a charming creature,"

regarding the slender white shape with much approbation,--adding, with a smile,

as she met the girl's eye,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Ah, I see the difficulty, now; you are disturbed because there is not a bit of

lace over these pretty shoulders of yours. Now don't be absurd, Dora; the dress

is perfectly proper, or Madam Tiphany never would have sent it home. It is the

fashion, child; and many a girl with such a figure would go twice as

decolletee, and think nothing of it, I assure you."<p>



<p>



Debby shook her head with an energy that set the pink heather-bells a-tremble

in her hair, and her color deepened beautifully as she said, with reproachful

eyes,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Aunt Pen, I think there is a better fashion in every young girls' heart than

any Madame Tiphany can teach. I am very grateful for all you have done for me,

but I cannot go into public in such an undress as this; my mother would never

allow it, and father never forgive it. Please don't ask me to, for indeed I

cannot do it even for you."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby looked so pathetic that both mistress and maid broke into a laugh which

somewhat reassured the young lady, who allowed her determined features to relax

into a smile, as she said,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Now, Aunt Pen, you want me to look pretty and be a credit to you; but how

would you like to see my face the color of those geraniums all evening?"<p>



<p>



<p>



"Why, Dora, you are out of your mind to ask such a thing, when you know it's

the desire of my life to keep your color down and make you look more delicate,"

said her aunt, alarmed at the fearful prospect of a peony-faced protegee.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Well, I should be anything but that, if I wore this gown in its present

waistless condition; so here is a remedy which will prevent such a calamity and

ease my mind."<p>



<p>



<p>



As she spoke, Debby tied on her little blonde fichu with a gesture which left

nothing more to be said. <p>



<p>



<p>



Victorine scolded, and clasped her hands; but Mrs. Carroll, fearing to push her

authority too far, made a virtue of necessity, saying, resignedly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Have your own way, Dora, but in return oblige me by being agreeable to such

persons as I may introduce to you; and some day, when I ask a favor remember

how much I hope to do for you, and grant it cheerfully."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Indeed I will, Aunt Pen, if it is anything I can do without disobeying

mother's 'notions,' as you call them. Ask me to wear an orange-colored gown, or

dance with the plainest, poorest man in the room, and I'll do it; for there

never was a kinder aunt than mine in all the world," cried Debby, eager to

atone for her seeming wilfulness, and really grateful for her escape from what

seemed to her benighted mind a very imminent peril.<p>



<p>



<p>



Like a clover-blossom in a vase of camellias little Debby looked that night

among the dashing or languid women who surrounded her; for she possessed the

charm they had lost,--the freshness of her youth. Innocent gayety sat smiling

in her eyes, healthful roses bloomed upon her cheek, and maiden modesty crowned

her like a garland. She was the creature that she seemed, and, yielding to the

influence of the hour, danced to the music of her own blithe heart. Many felt

the spell whose secret they had lost the power to divine, and watched the

girlish figure as if it were symbol of their early aspirations dawning freshly

from the dimness of their past. More than one old man thought again of some

little maid whose love made his boyish days a pleasant memory to him now. More

than one smiling fop felt the emptiness of his smooth speech, when the truthful

eyes looked up into his own; and more than one pale woman sighed regretfully

within herself, "I, too, was a happy-hearted creature once!"<p>



<p>



<p>



"That Mr. Evan does not seem very anxious to claim our acquaintance, after all,

and I think better of him on that account.  Has he spoken to you to-night,

Dora?" asked Mrs. Carroll, as Debby dropped down beside her after a "splendid

polka."<p>



<p>



<p>



"No, Ma'am, he only bowed. You see some people are not so presuming as other

people thought they were; for we are not the most attractive beings on the

planet; therefore a gentleman can be polite and then forget us without breaking

any of the Ten Commandments. Don't be offended with him yet, for he may prove

to be some great creature with a finer pedigree than any of 'our fist

families.' Mr. Leavenworth, as you know everybody, perhaps you can relieve Aunt

Pen's mind, by telling her something about the tall, brown man standing behind

the lady with salmon-colored hair."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Joe, who was fanning the top of Debby's head with the best intentions in

life, took a survey, and answered readily,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Why, that's Frank Evan. I know him, and a deused good fellow he is,-- though

he don't belong to our set, you know."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Indeed! pray, tell us something about him, Mr. Leavenworth. We met in the

cars, and he did us a favor of two. Who and what is the man?" asked Mrs.

Carroll, relenting at once toward a person who was favorably spoken of by one

who did belong to her "set."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Well, let me see," began Mr. Joe, whose narrative powers were not great. "He

is a book-keeper in my Uncle Josh Loring's importing concern, and a powerful

smart man, they say. There's some kind of clever story about his father's

leaving a load of debts, and Frank's working a deused number of years till they

were paid. Good of him, wasn't it? Then, just as he was going to take things

easier and enjoy life a bit, his mother died, and that rather knocked him  up,

you see. He fell sick, and came to grief generally, Uncle Josh said; so he was

ordered off to get righted, and here he is, looking like a tombstone. I've a

regard for Frank, for he took care of me through the smallpox a year ago, and I

don't forget things of that sort; so, if you wish to be introduced, Mrs.

Carroll, I'll trot him out with pleasure, and make a proud man of him."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll glanced at Debby, and as that young lady was regarding Mr. Joe

with a friendly aspect, owing to the warmth of his words, she graciously

assented, and the youth departed on his errand. Mr. Evan went though the

ceremony with a calmness wonderful to behold, considering the position of one

lady and the charms of the other, and soon glided into the conversation with

the ease of a more accomplished courtier.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Now I must tear myself away, for I'm engaged to that stout Miss Bandoline for

this dance. She's a friend of my sister's, and I must do the civil, you know;

powerful slow work it is, too, but I pity the poor soul,--upon my life, I do";

and Mr. Joe assumed the air of a martyr.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby looked up with a wicked smile in her eyes, as she said,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Ah, that sounds very amiable here; but in five minutes you'll be murmuring in

Miss Bandoline's ear,--'I've been pining to come to you this half hour, but I

was obliged to take out that Miss Wilder, you see,--countrified little thing

enough, but not bad-looking, and has a rich aunt; so I've done my duty to her,

but deuse take me if I can stand it any longer.'"<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Evan joined in Debby's merriment; but Mr. Joe was so appalled at the sudden

attack that he could only stammer a remonstrance and beat a hasty retreat,

wondering how on earth she came to know that his favorite style of making

himself agreeable to one young lady was by decrying another.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Dora, my love, that is very rude, and 'Deuse' is not a proper expression for a

woman's lips. Pray, restrain your lively tongue, for strangers may not

understand that it is nothing but the sprightliness of your disposition which

sometimes runs away with you."<p>



<p>



<p>



"It was only a quotation, and I thought you would admire anything Mr.

Leavenworth said, Aunt Pen," replied Debby, demurely.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll trod on her foot, and abruptly changed the conversation, by

saying, with an appearance of deep interest,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Mr. Evan, you are doubtless connected with the Malcoms of Georgia; for they, I

believe, are descended from the ancient Evans of Scotland. They are a very

wealthy and aristocratic family, and I remember seeing their coat-of arms once:

three bannocks and thistle."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Evan had been standing before them with a composure which impressed Mrs.

Carroll with a belief in his gentle blood, for she remembered her own fussy,

plebeian husband, whose fortune had never been able to purchase him the manners

of a gentleman. Mr. Evan only grew a little more erect, as he replied, with an

untroubled mien,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I cannot claim relationship with the Malcoms of Georgia or the Evans of

Scotland, I believe, Madam. My father was a farmer, my grandfather a

blacksmith, and beyond that my ancestors may have been street-sweepers, for

anything I know; but whatever they were, I fancy they were honest men, for that

has always been our boast, though, like President Jackson's, our coat -of-arms

is nothing but 'a pair of shirt-sleeves.'"<p>



<p>



<p>



From Debby's eyes there shot a bright glance of admiration for the young man

who could look two comely women in the face and serenely own that he was poor.

Mrs. Carroll tried to appear at ease, and gliding out of personalities,

expatiated on the comfort of "living in a land where fame and fortune were

attainable by all who chose to earn them," and the contempt she felt for those

"who had no sympathy with the humbler classes, no interest in the welfare of

the race." and many more moral reflections as new and original as the

Multiplication-Table or the Westminster Catechism. To all of which Mr. Evan

listened with polite deference, though there was something in the keen

intelligence of his eye that made Debby blush for shallow Aunt Pen, and rejoice

when the good lady got out of her depth and seized upon a new subject as a

drowning mariner would a hen-coop.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Dora, Mr. Ellenborough is coming this way; you have danced with him but once,

and he is a very desirable partner; so, pray, accept, if he asks you," said

Mrs. Carroll, watching a far-off individual who seemed steering his zigzag

course toward them.<p>



<p>



<p>



"I never intend to dance with Mr. Ellenborough again, so please don't urge me,

Aunt Pen"; and Debby knit her brows with a somewhat irate expression.<p>



<p>



<p>



"My love, you astonish me! He is a most agreeable and accomplished young

man,--spent three years in Paris, moves in the first circles, and is considered

an ornament to fashionable society. What can be your objection, Dora?" cried

Mrs. Carroll, looking as alarmed as if her niece had suddenly announced her

belief in the Koran.<p>



<p>



<p>



"One of his accomplishments consists in drinking Champagne till he is not a

'desirable partner' for any young lady with a prejudice in favor of decency.

His moving in 'circles' is just what I complain of; and if he is an ornament, I

prefer my society undecorated. Aunt Pen, I cannot make the nice distinctions

you would have me, and a sot in broadcloth is as odious as one in rags. Forgive

me, but I cannot dance with that silver-labelled decanter again."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby was a genuine little piece of womanhood; and though she tried to speak

lightly, her color deepened, as she remembered looks that had wounded her like

insults, and her indignant eyes silenced the excuses rising to her aunt's lips.

Mrs. Carroll began to rue the hour that she ever undertook the guidance of

Sister Deborah's headstrong child, and for an instant heartily wished she had

left her to bloom unseen in the shadow of the parsonage; but she concealed her

annoyance, still hoping to overcome the girl's absurd resolve, by saying,

mildly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"As you please, dear; but if you refuse Mr. Ellenborough, you will be obliged

to sit through the dance, which is your favorite, you know."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby's countenance fell, for she had forgotten that, and the Lancers was to

her the crowning rapture of the night. She paused a moment, and Aunt Pen

brightened; but Debby made her little sacrifice to principle as heroically as

many a greater one had been made, and, with a wistful look down the long room,

answered steadily, though her foot kept time to the first strains as she

spoke,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Then I will sit, Aunt Pen; for that is preferable to staggering about the room

with a partner who has no idea of the laws of gravitation."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Shall I have the honor of averting either calamity?" said Mr. Evan, coming to

the rescue with a devotion beautiful to see; for dancing was nearly a lost art

with him, and the Lancers to a novice is equal to a second Labyrinth of

Crete.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Oh, thank you!" cried Debby, tumbling fan, bouquet, and handkerchief into Mrs.

Carroll's lap, with a look of relief that repaid him fourfold for the trials he

was about to undergo. They went merrily away together, leaving Aunt Pen to wish

that  it was according to the laws of etiquette to rap officious gentlemen over

the knuckles, when they introduce their fingers into private pies without

permission from the chief cook. How the dance went Debby hardly knew, for the

conversation fell upon books, and in the interest of her favorite theme she

found even the "grand square" an impertinent interruption, while her own

deficiencies became almost as great as her partner's; yet, when the music ended

with a flourish, and her last curtsy was successfully achieved, she longed to

begin all over again, and secretly regretted that she was engaged four deep.<p>



<p>



"How do you like our new acquaintance, Dora?" asked Aunt Pen, following Joe

Leavenworth with her eye, as the "yellow-haired laddie" whirled by with the

ponderous Miss Flora. "Very much; and I'm glad we met as we did, for it makes

things free and easy, and that is so agreeable in this ceremonious place,"

replied Debby, looking in quite an opposite direction.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Well, I'm delighted to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid you had taken a

dislike to him, and he is really a very charming young man, just the sort of

person to make a pleasant companion for a few weeks. These little friendships

are part of the summer's amusement, and do no harm; so smile away, Dora, and

enjoy yourself while you may.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Yes, Aunt, I certainly will, and all the more because I have found a sensible

soul to talk to. Do you know, he is very witty and well informed though he says

he never had much time for self-cultivation? But I think trouble makes people

wise, and he seems to have had a good deal, though he leaves it for others to

tell of. I am glad you are willing I should know him, for I shall enjoy talking

about my pet heroes with him as a relief from the silly chatter I must keep up

most of the time."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll was a woman of one idea; and though a slightly puzzled expression

appeared in her face, she listened approvingly, and answered, with a gracious

smile,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Of course, I should not object to your knowing such a person, my love; but I'd

no idea Joe Leavenworth was a literary man, or had known much trouble, except

his father's death and his sister Clementina's runaway-marriage with her

drawing-master."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby opened her brown eyes very wide, and hastily picked at the down on her

fan, but had no time to correct her aunt's mistake, for the real subject of her

commendations appeared at that moment, and Mrs. Carroll was immediately

absorbed in the consumption of a large pink ice.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



"That girl is what I call a surprise-party, now," remarked Mr. Joe

confidentially to his cigar, as he pulled off his coat and stuck his feet up in

the privacy of his own apartment. "She looks as mild as strawberries and cream

till you come to the complimentary, then she turns on a fellow with that deused

satirical look of hers, and makes him feel like a fool. I'll try the moral

dodge to-morrow, and see what effect that will have; for she is mighty taking,

and I must amuse myself somehow, you know."<p>



<p>



<p>



"How many years will it take to change that fresh-hearted little girl into

fashionable belle, I wonder?" thought Frank Evan, as he climbed the four

flights that led to his "sky-parlor."<p>



<p>



<p>



"What a curious world this is!" mused Debby, with her nightcap in her hand.

"The right seems odd and rude, and the wrong respectable and easy, and this

sort of life a merry-go-round, with no higher aim than pleasure. Well, I have

made my Declaration of Independence, and Aunt Pen must be ready for a

Revolution, if she taxes me too heavily."<p>



<p>



<p>



As she leaned her hot cheek on her arm, Debby's eye fell on the quaint little

cap made by the motherly hands that never were tired of working for her. She

touched it tenderly, and love's simple magic swept the gathering shadows from

her face, and left it clear again, as her thoughts flew home like birds into

the shelter of their nest.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Good night, mother! I'll face temptation steadily. I'll try to take life

cheerily, and do nothing that shall make your dear face a reproach, when it

looks into my own again."<p>



<p>



<p>



Then Debby said her prayers like any pious child, and lay down to dream of

pulling buttercups with Baby Bess, and singing in the twilight on her father's

knee.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The history of Debby's first day might serve as a sample of most that followed,

as week after week went by with varying pleasures and increasing interest to

more than one young debutante. Mrs. Carroll did her best, but Debby was too

simple for a belle, too honest for a flirt, too independent for a fine lady;

she would be nothing but her sturdy little self, open as daylight, gay as a

lark, and blunt as any Puritan. Poor Aunt Pen was in despair, till she observed

that the girl often "took" with the very peculiarities which she was lamenting;

this somewhat consoled her, and she tried to make the best of the pretty bit of

homespun which would not and could not become velvet or brocade. Seguin,

Ellenborough, &amp; Co. looked with lordly scorn upon her, as a worm blind to

their attractions. Miss MacFlimsy and her "set" quizzed her unmercifully behind

her back, after being worsted in several passages of arms; and more than one

successful mamma condoled with Aunt Pen upon the terribly defective education

of her charge, till that stout matron could have found it in her heart to tweak

off their caps and walk on them, like the irascible Betsey Trotwood.<p>



<p>



<p>



But Debby had a circle of admirers who loved her with a sincerity few summer

queens could boast; for they were real friends, won by gentle arts, and

retained by the gracious sweetness of her nature. Moon-faced babies crowed and

clapped their chubby hands when she passed by their wicker thrones;

story-loving children clustered round her knee, and never were denied; pale

invalids found wild-flowers on their pillows; and forlorn papas forgot the

state of the money-market when she sang for them the homely airs their

daughters had no time to learn. Certain plain young ladies poured their woes

into her friendly ear, and were comforted; several smart Sophomores fell into a

state of chronic stammer, blush, and adoration, when she took a motherly

interest in their affairs; and a melancholy old Frenchman blessed her with the

enthusiasm of his nation, because she put a posy in the button-hole of his

rusty coat, and never failed to smile and bow as he passed by. Yet Debby was no

Edgeworth heroine, preternaturally prudent, wise, and untemptable, she had a

fine crop of piques, vanities, and dislikes growing up under this new style of

cultivation. She loved admiration, enjoyed her purple and fine linen, hid

new-born envy, disappointed hope, and wounded pride behind a smiling face, and

often thought with a sigh of the humdrum duties that awaited her at home. But

under the airs and graces Aunt Pen cherished with such sedulous care under the

flounces and furbelows Victorine daily adjusted with groans, under the polish

which she acquired with feminine ease, the girl's heart still beat steadfast

and strong, and conscience kept watch and ward that no traitor should enter in

to surprise the citadel which mother-love had tried to garrison so well.<p>



<p>



<p>



In pursuance of his sage resolve, Mr. Joe tried the "moral dodge," as he

elegantly expressed it, and, failing in that, followed it up with the tragic,

religious, negligent , and devoted ditto; but acting was not his forte, so

Debby routed him in all; and at last, when he was at his wit's end for an idea,

she suggested one, and completed her victory by saying pleasantly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"You took me behind the curtain too soon, and now the paste-diamonds and

cotton-velvet don't impose upon me a bit. Just be your natural self, and we

shall get on nicely, Mr. Leavenworth."<p>



<p>



<p>



The novelty of the proposal struck his fancy, and after a few relapses it was

carried into effect, and thenceforth, with Debby, he became the simple,

good-humored lad Nature designed him to be, and, as a proof of it, soon fell

very sincerely in love.<p>



<p>



<p>



Frank Evan, seated in the parquet of society, surveyed the dress-circle with

much the same expression that Debby had seen during Aunt Pen's oration; but he

soon neglected that amusement to watch several actors in the drama going on

before his eyes, while a strong desire to perform a part therein slowly took

possession of his mind. Debby always had a look of welcome when he came, always

treated him with the kindness of a generous woman who has had an opportunity to

forgive, and always watched the serious, solitary man with a great compassion

for his loss, a growing admiration for his upright life. More than once the

beach-birds saw two figures pacing the sands at sunrise with the peace of early

day upon their faces and the light of a kindred mood shining in their eyes.

More than once the friendly ocean made a third in the pleasant conversation,

and its low undertone came and went between the mellow bass and the silvery

treble of the human voices with a melody that lent another charm to interviews

which soon grew wondrous sweet to man and maid. Aunt Pen seldom saw the twain

together, seldom spoke of Evan; and Debby held her peace, for, when she planned

to make her innocent confessions, she found that what seemed much to her was

nothing to another ear and scarcely worth the telling; so, unconscious as yet

whither the green path led, she went on her way, leading two lives, one rich

and earnest, hoarded deep within herself, the other frivolous and gay for all

the world to criticize. But those venerable spinsters, the Fates, took the

matter into their own hands, and soon got the better of those short-sighted

matrons, Mesdames Grundy and Carroll; for, long before they knew it, Frank and

Debby had begun to read together a book greater than Dickens ever wrote, and

when they had come to the fairest part of the sweet story Adam first told Eve,

they looked for the name upon the title-page, and found that it was "Love."<p>



<p>



Eight weeks came and went,--eight wonderfully happy weeks to Debby and her

friend; for "propinquity" had worked more wonders than poor Mrs. Carroll knew,

as the only one she saw or guessed was the utter captivation of Joe

Leavenworth. He had become "himself" to such an extent that a change of

identity would have been a relief; for the object of his adoration showed no

signs of relenting, and he began to fear, that, as Debby said, her heart was

"not in the market." She was always friendly, but never made those interesting

betrayals of regard which are so encouraging to youthful gentlemen "who fain

would climb, yet fear to fall." She never blushed when he pressed her hand,

never fainted or grew pale when he appeared with a smashed trotting-wagon and a

black eye, and actually slept through a serenade that would have won any other

woman's soul out of her body with its despairing quavers. Matters were getting

desperate; for horses lost their charms, "flowing bowls" palled upon his lips,

ruffled shirt-bosoms no longer delighted him, and hops possessed no soothing

power to allay the anguish of his mind. Mr. Seguin, after unavailing ridicule

and pity, took compassion on him, and from his large experience suggested a

remedy, just as he was departing for a more congenial sphere.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Now don't be an idiot, Joe, but, if you want to keep your hand in and go

through a regular chapter of flirtation, just right about face, and devote

yourself to some one else. Nothing like jealousy to teach womankind their own

minds, and a touch of it will bring little Wilder round in a jiffy. Try it, my

boy, and good luck to you!"--with which Christian advice Mr. Seguin slapped his

pupil on the shoulder, and disappeared, like a modern Mephistopheles, in a

cloud of cigar-smoke.<p>



<p>



<p>



"I'm glad he's gone, for in my present state of mind he's not up to my mark at

all. I'll try his plan, though, and flirt with Clara West; she's engaged, so it

won't damage her affections; her lover isn't here, so it won't disturb his;

and, by Jove! I must do something, for I can't stand this suspense."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby was infinitely relieved by this new move, and infinitely amused as she

guessed the motive that prompted it; but the more contented she seemed, the

more violently Mr. Joe flirted with her rival, till at last weak-minded Miss

Clara began to think her absent George the most undesirable of lovers, and to

mourn that she ever said "Yes" to a merchant's clerk, when she might have said

it to a merchant's son. Aunt Pen watched and approved this stratagem, hoped for

the best results, and believed the day won when Debby grew pale and silent, and

followed with her eyes the young couple who were playing battledoor and

shuttlecock with each other's hearts, as if she took some interest in the game.

But Aunt Pen clashed her cymbals too soon; for Debby's trouble had a better

source than jealousy, and in the silence of the sleepless nights that stole her

bloom she was taking counsel of her own full heart, and resolving to serve

another woman as she would herself be served in a like peril, though etiquette

was outraged and the customs of polite society turned upside down.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



"Look, Aunt Pen! what lovely shells and moss I've got! Such a splendid scramble

over the rocks as I've had with Mrs. Duncan's boys! It seemed so like home to

run and sing with a troop of topsy-turvy children that it did me good; and I

wish you had all been there to see," cried Debby, running into the drawing

room, one day, where Mrs. Carroll and a circle of ladies sat enjoying a dish of

highly flavored scandal, as they exercised their eyesight over fancy-work.<p>



<p>



<p>



"My dear Dora, spare my nerves; and if you have any regard for the proprieties

of life, don't go romping in the sun with a parcel of noisy boys. If you could

see what an object you are, I think you would try to imitate Miss Clara, who is

always a model of elegant repose."<p>



<p>



<p>



Miss West primmed up her lips, and settled a fold in her ninth flounce, as Mrs.

Carroll spoke, while the whole group fixed their eyes with dignified

disapproval on the invader of their refined society. Debby had come like a

fresh wind into a sultry room; but no one welcomed the healthful visitant, no

one saw a pleasant picture in the bright-faced girl with wind-tossed hair and

rustic hat heaped with moss and many-tinted shells; they only saw that her gown

was wet, her gloves forgotten, and her scarf trailing at her waist in a manner

no well-bred lady could approve. The sunshine faded out of Debby's face, and

there was a touch of bitterness in her tone, as she glanced at the circle of

fashion-plates, saying with an earnestness which caused Miss West to open her

pale eyes to their widest extent,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Aunt Pen, don't freeze me yet,--don't take away my faith in simple things, but

let me be a child a little longer,--let me play and sing and keep my spirit

blithe among the dandelions and the robins while I can; for trouble comes soon

enough, and all my life will be the richer and the better for a happy youth.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll had nothing at hand to offer in reply to this appeal, and four

ladies dropped their work to stare; but Frank Evan looked in from the piazza,

saying, as he beckoned like a boy,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I'll play with you, Miss Dora; come and make sand pies upon the shore. Please

let her, Mrs. Carroll; we'll be very good, and not wet our pinafores or

feet."<p>



<p>



<p>



Without waiting for permission, Debby poured her treasures in the lap of a

certain lame Freddy, and went away to a kind of play she had never known

before. Quiet as a chidden child, she walked beside her companion, who looked

down at the little figure, longing to take it on his knee and call the sunshine

back again. That he dared not do; but accident, the lover's friend, performed

the work, and did him a good turn beside. The old Frenchman was slowly

approaching, when a frolicsome wind whisked off his hat and sent it skimming

along the beach. In spite of her late lecture, away went Debby, and caught the

truant chapeau just as a wave was hurrying up to claim it. This restored her

cheerfulness, and when she returned, she was herself again.<p>



<p>



<p>



"A thousand thanks; but does Mademoiselle remember the forfeit I might demand

to add to the favor she has already done me?" asked the gallant old gentleman,

as Debby took the hat off her own head, and presented it with a martial

salute.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Ah, I had forgotten that; but you may claim it, Sir,--indeed, you may; I only

wish I could do something more to give you pleasure"; and Debby looked up into

the withered face which had grown familiar to her, with kind eyes, full of pity

and respect.<p>



<p>



<p>



Her manner touched the old man very much; he bent his gray head before her,

saying, gratefully,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"My child, I am not good enough to salute these blooming cheeks; but I shall

pray the Virgin to reward you for the compassion you bestow on the poor exile,

and I shall keep your memory very green through all my life."<p>



<p>



<p>



He kissed her hand, as if it were a queen's, and went on his way, thinking of

the little daughter whose death left him childless in a foreign land.<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby softly began to sing, "Oh, come unto the yellow sands!" but stopped in

the middle of a line, to say,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Shall I tell you why I did what Aunt Pen would call a very unladylike and

improper thing, Mr. Evan?"<p>



<p>



<p>



"If you will be so kind"; and her companion looked delighted at the confidence

about to be reposed in him.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Somewhere across this great wide sea I hope I have a brother," Debby said,

with softened voice and a wistful look into the dim horizon. "Five years ago he

left us, and we have never heard from him since, except to know that he landed

safely in Australia. People tell us he is dead; but I believe he will yet come

home; and so I love to help and pity any man who needs it, rich or poor, young

or old, hoping that as I do by them some tender-hearted woman far away will do

by Brother Will."<p>



<p>



<p>



As Debby spoke, across Frank Evan's face there passed the look that seldom

comes but once to any young man's countenance; for suddenly the moment dawned

when love asserted its supremacy, and putting pride, doubt, and fear underneath

its feet, ruled the strong heart royally and bent it to its will. Debby's

thoughts had floated across the sea; but they came swiftly back when her

companion spoke again, steadily and slow, but with a subtile change in tone and

manner which arrested them at once.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Miss Dora, if you should meet a man who had known a laborious youth, a

solitary manhood, who had no sweet domestic ties to make home beautiful and

keep his nature warm, who longed most ardently to be so blessed, and made it

the aim of his life to grow more worthy the good gift, should it ever come,--if

you should learn that you possessed the power to make this fellow-creature's

happiness, could you find it in your gentle heart to take compassion on him for

the love of 'Brother Will'?"<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby was silent, wondering why heart and nerves and brain were stirred by such

a sudden thrill, why she dared not look up, and why, when she desired so much

to speak, she could only answer, in a voice that sounded strange to her own

ears,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I cannot tell."<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, steadily and slow, with strong emotion deepening and softening his

voice, the lover at her side went on,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Will you ask yourself this question in some quiet hour? For such a man has

lived in the sunshine of your presence for eight happy weeks, and now, when his

holiday is done, he finds that the old solitude will be more sorrowful than

ever, unless he can discover whether his summer dream will change into a

beautiful reality. Miss Dora, I have very little to offer you; a faithful heart

to cherish you, a strong arm to work for you, and honest name to give into your

keeping,--these are all; but if they have any worth in your eyes, they are most

truly yours forever."<p>



<p>



<p>



Debby was steadying her voice to reply, when a troop of bathers came shouting

down the bank, and she took flight into her dressing-room, there to sit staring

at the wall, till the advent of Aunt Pen forced her to resume the business of

the hour by assuming her aquatic attire and stealing shyly down into the

surf.<p>



<p>



<p>



Frank Evan, still pacing in the footprints they had lately made, watched the

lithe figure tripping to and fro, and, as he looked, murmured to himself the

last line of a ballad Debby sometimes sang,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Dance light! for my heart it lies under your feet, love!"<p>



<p>



<p>



Presently a great wave swept Debby up, and stranded her very near him, much to

her confusion and his satisfaction. Shaking the spray out her eyes, she was

hurrying away, when Frank said,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"You will trip, Miss Dora; let me tie these strings for you"; and, suiting the

action to the word, he knelt down and began to fasten the cords of her bathing

shoe.<p>



<p>



Debby stood looking down at the tall head bent before her, with a curious sense

of wonder that a look from her could make a strong man flush and pale, as he

had done and she was trying to concoct some friendly speech, when Frank, still

fumbling at the knots, said very earnestly and low,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Forgive me, if I am selfish in pressing for an answer; but I must go tomorrow,

and a single word will change my whole future for the better or the worse.

Won't you speak it, Dora?"<p>



<p>



<p>



If they had been alone, Debby would have put her arms about his neck, and said

it with all her heart; but she had a presentiment that she should cry, if her

love found vent; and here forty pairs of eyes were on them, and salt water

seemed superfluous. Besides, Debby had not breathed the air of coquetry so long

without a touch of the infection; and the love of power, that lies dormant in

the meekest woman's breast, suddenly awoke and tempted her.<p>



<p>



<p>



"If you catch me before I reach that rock, perhaps I will say 'Yes,'" was her

unexpected answer; and before her lover caught her meaning, she was floating

leisurely away.<p>



<p>



<p>



Frank was not in bathing-costume, and Debby never dreamed that he would take

her at her word; but she did not know the man she had to deal with; for, taking

no second though, he flung hat and coat away, and dashed into the sea. This

gave a serious aspect to Debby's foolish jest. A feeling of dismay seized her,

when she saw a resolute face dividing the waves behind her, and thought of the

rash challenge she had given; but she had a spirit of her own, and had profited

well by Mr. Joe's instructions; so she drew a long breath, and swam as if for

life, instead of love. Evan was incumbered by his clothing, and Debby had much

the start of him; but, like a second Leander, he hoped to win his Hero, and,

lending every muscle to the work, gained rapidly upon the little hat which was

his beacon through the foam. Debby heard the deep breathing drawing nearer and

nearer, as her pursuer's strong arms cleft the water and sent it rippling past

her lips. Something like terror took possession of her for the strength seemed

going out of her limbs, and the rock appeared to recede before her; but the

unconquerable blood of the Pilgrims was in her veins and "Nil desperandum" her

motto; so, setting her teeth, she muttered, defiantly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I'll not be beaten, if I go to the bottom!"<p>



<p>



<p>



A great splashing arose, and when Evan recovered the use of his eyes, the

pagoda-hat had taken a sudden turn, and seemed making for the farthest point of

the goal. "I am sure of her now," thought Frank; and, like a gallant sea-god,

he bore down upon his prize, clutching it with a shout of triumph. But the hat

was empty, and like a mocking echo came Debby's laugh, as she climbed,

exhausted, to a cranny in the rock.<p>



<p>



<p>



"A very neat thing, by Jove! Deuse take me if you a'n't 'an honor to your

teacher, and terror to the foe,' Miss Wilder," cried Mr. Joe, as he came up

from a solitary cruise and dropped anchor at her side. "Here, bring along the

hat, Evan; I'm going to crown the victor with appropriate

what-d'-ye-call-'ems," he continued, pulling a handful of sea-weed that looked

like well-boiled greens.<p>



<p>



<p>



Frank came up, smiling; but his lips were white, and in his eye a look Debby

could not meet; so, being full of remorse, she naturally assumed an air of

gayety, and began to sing the merriest air she knew, merely because she longed

to throw herself upon the stones and cry violently.<p>



<p>



<p>



"It was 'most as exciting as a regatta, and you pulled well, Evan; but you had

too much ballast aboard, and Miss Wilder ran up false colors just in time to

save her ship. What was the wager?" asked the lively Joseph complacently

surveying his marine millinery, which would have scandalized a fashionable

mermaid.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Only a trifle," answered Debby, knotting up her braids with a revengeful

jerk.<p>



<p>



<p>



"It's taken the wind out of your sails, I fancy, Evan, for you look immensely

Byronic with the starch minus in you collar and your hair in a poetic toss.

Come, I'll try a race with you; and Miss Wilder will dance all the evening with

the winner. Bless the man, what's he doing down there? Burying sunfish, hey?"<p>



<p>



<p>



Frank had been sitting below them on a narrow strip of sand, absently piling up

a little mound that bore some likeness to a grave. As his companion spoke, he

looked at it, an a sudden flush of feeling swept across his face, as he

replied,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"No, only a dead hope."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Deuse take it, yes, a good many of that sort of craft founder in these waters

as I know to my sorrow"; and, sighing tragically, Mr. Joe turned to help Debby

from her perch, but she had glided silently into the sea and was gone.<p>



<p>



<p>



For the next four hours the poor girl suffered the sharpest pain she had ever

known; for now she clearly saw the strait her folly had betrayed her into.

Frank Evan was a proud man, and would not ask her love again, believing she had

tacitly refused it; and how could she tell him that she had trifled with the

heart she wholly loved and longed to make her own? She could not confide in

Aunt Pen, for that worldly lady would have no sympathy to bestow. She longed

for her mother; but there was no time to write, for Frank was going on the

morrow,--might even then be gone; and as this fear came over her, she covered

up her face and wished that she were dead. Poor Debby? her last mistake was

sadder than her first, and she was reaping a bitter harvest from her summer's

sowing. She sat and thought till her cheeks burned and her temples throbbed;

but she dared not ease her pain with tears. The gong sounded like a

Judgment-Day trump of doom, and she trembled at the idea of confronting many

eyes with such a telltale face; but she could not stay behind, for Aunt Pen

must know the cause.  She tried to play her hard part well; but wherever she

looked, some fresh anxiety appeared, as if every fault and folly of those

months had blossomed suddenly within the hour. She saw Frank Evan more sombre

and more solitary than when she met him first, and cried regretfully within

herself, "How could I so forget the truth I owed him?" She saw Clara West

watching with eager eyes for the coming of young Leavenworth, and sighed, "This

is the fruit of my wicked vanity!" She saw Aunt Pen regarding her with an

anxious face, and longed to say, "Forgive me, for I have not been sincere!" At

last, as her trouble grew, she resolved to go away and have a quiet "think,"--a

remedy which had served her in many a lesser perplexity; so, stealing out, she

went to a grove of cedars usually deserted at that hour. But in ten minutes Joe

Leavenworth appeared at the door of the summer-house, and, looking in, said,

with a well-acted start of pleasure and surprise,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Beg pardon, I thought there was no one here. My dear Miss Wilder, you look

contemplative; but I fancy it wouldn't do to ask the subject of your

meditations, would it?"<p>



<p>



<p>



He paused with such an evident intention of remaining that Debby resolved to

make use of the moment, and ease her conscience of one care that burdened it;

therefore she answered his questions with her usual directness,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"My meditations were partly about you."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Joe was guilty of the weakness of blushing violently and looking immensely

gratified; but his rapture was of short duration, for Debby went on very

earnestly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"I believe I am going to do what you may consider a very impertinent thing; but

I would rather be unmannerly than unjust to others or untrue to my own sense of

right. Mr. Leavenworth, if you were an older man, I should not dare to say this

to you; but I have brothers of my own, and, remembering how many unkind things

they do for want of thought, I venture to remind you that a woman's heart is a

perilous plaything, and too tender to be used for a selfish purpose or an

hour's pleasure. I know this kind of amusement is not considered wrong; but it

is wrong, and I cannot shut my eyes to the fact, or sit silent while another

woman is allowed to deceive herself and wound the heart that trusts her. Oh if

you love your own sisters, be generous, be just, and do not destroy that poor

girl's happiness, but go away before your sport becomes a bitter pain to

her!"<p>



<p>



<p>



Joe Leavenworth had stood staring at Debby with a troubled countenance, feeling

as if all the misdemeanors of his life were about to be paraded before him;

but, as he listened to her plea, the womanly spirit that prompted it appealed

more loudly than her words, and in his really generous heart he felt regret for

what had never seemed a fault before. Shallow as he was, nature was stronger

than education, and he admired and accepted what many a wiser, worldlier man

would have resented with anger or contempt. He loved Debby with all his little

might; he meant to tell her so, and graciously present his fortune and himself

for her acceptance; but now, when the moment came, the well-turned speech he

had prepared vanished from his memory, and with the better eloquence of feeling

he blundered out his passion like a very boy.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Miss Dora, I never meant to make trouble between Clara and her lover ;upon my

soul I didn't, and with Seguin had not put the notion into my head, since it

has given you pain. I only tried to pique you into showing some regret when I

neglected you; but you didn't and then I got desperate and didn't care what

became of any one. Oh, Dora, if you knew how much I loved you, I am sure you'd

forgive it, and let me prove my repentance by giving up everything that you

dislike. I mean what I say; upon my life I do; and I'll keep my word, if you

will only let me hope."<p>



<p>



<p>



If Debby had wanted a proof of her love for Frank Evan, she might have found it

in the fact that she had words enough at her command now, and no difficulty in

being sisterly pitiful toward her second suitor.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Please get up," she said; for Mr. Joe, feeling very humble and very earnest,

had gone down upon his knees, and sat there entirely regardless of his personal

appearance.<p>



<p>



<p>



He obeyed; and Debby stood looking up at him with her kindest aspect, as she

said, more tenderly than she had ever spoken to him before,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Thank you for the affection you offer me, but I cannot accept it, for I have

nothing to give you in return but the friendliest regard, the most sincere

good-will. I know you will forgive me, and do for your own sake the good things

you would have done for mine, that I may add to my esteem a real respect for

one who has been very kind to me."<p>



<p>



<p>



"I'll try,--indeed, I will, Miss Dora, though it will be powerful hard without

yourself for a help and a reward."<p>



<p>



<p>



Poor Joe choked a little, but called up an unexpected manliness, and added,

stoutly,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Don't think I shall be offended at your speaking so, or saying 'No' to

me,--not a bit; it's all right, and I'm much obliged to you. I might have known

you couldn't care for such a fellow as I am, and don't blame you, for nobody in

the world is good enough for you. I'll go away at once, I'll try to keep my

promise, and I hope you'll be very happy all your life."<p>



<p>



<p>



He shook Debby's hands heartily, and hurried down the steps, but at the bottom

paused and looked back. Debby stood upon the threshold with sunshine dancing on

her winsome face, and kind words trembling on her lips; for the moment it

seemed impossible to part, and, with an impetuous gesture, he cried to her,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Oh, Dora, let me stay and try to win you! for everything is possible to love,

and I never knew how dear you were to me till now!"<p>



<p>



<p>



There were sudden tears in the young man's eyes, the flush of a genuine emotion

on his cheek the tremor of an ardent longing in his voice, and, for the first

time, a very true affection strengthened his whole countenance. Debby's heart

was full of penitence; she had given so much pain to more than one that she

longed to atone for it,--longed to do some very friendly thing, and soothe some

trouble such as she herself had known. She looked into the eager face uplifted

to her own and thought of Will, then stooped and touched her lover's forehead

with the lips that softly whispered, "No."<p>



<p>



<p>



If she had cared for him, she never would have done it; poor Joe knew that, and

murmuring an incoherent "Thank you!" he rushed away, feeling very much as he

remembered to have felt when his baby sister died and he wept his grief away

upon his mother's neck. He began his preparations for departure at once, in a

burst of virtuous energy quite refreshing to behold, thinking within himself,

as he flung his cigar-case into the grate, kicked a billiard-ball into a

corner, and suppressed his favorite allusion to the Devil,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"This is a new sort of thing to me, but I can bear it, and upon my life I think

I feel the better for it already."<p>



<p>



<p>



And so he did; for though he was no Augustine to turn in an hour from worldly

hopes and climb to sainthood through long years of inward strife, yet in

aftertimes no one knew how many false steps had been saved, how many small sins

repented of, through the power of the memory that far away a generous woman

waited to respect him, and in his secret soul he owned that one of the best

moments of his life was that in which little Debby Wilder whispered "No," and

kissed him.<p>



<p>



<p>



As he passed from sight, the girl leaned her head upon her hand, thinking

sorrowfully to herself,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"What right had I to censure him, when my own actions are so far from true? I

have done a wicked thing, and as an honest girl I should undo it, if I can. I

have broken through the rules of a false propriety for Clara's sake; can I not

do as much for Frank's? I will. I'll find him, if I search the house,--and tell

him all, though I never dare to look him in the face again, and Aunt Pen sends

me home to-morrow."<p>



<p>



<p>



Full of zeal and courage, Debby caught up her hat and ran down the steps, but,

as she saw Frank Evan coming up the path, a sudden panic fell upon her, and she

could only stand mutely waiting his approach.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is asserted that Love is blind; and on the strength of that popular delusion

novel heroes and heroines go blundering through three volumes of despair with

the plain truth directly under their absurd noses: but in real life this theory

is not supported; for to a living man the countenance of  a loving woman is

more eloquent than any language, more trustworthy than a world of proverbs,

more beautiful than the sweetest love-lay ever sung.<p>



<p>



<p>



Frank looked at Debby, and "all her heart stood up in her eyes," as she

stretched her hands to him, though her lips only whispered very low,--<p>



<p>



<p>



"Forgive me, and let me say the 'Yes' I should have said so long ago."<p>



<p>



<p>



Had she required any assurance of her lover's truth, or any reward for her own,

she would have found it in the change that dawned so swiftly in his face,

smoothing the lines upon his forehead, lighting the gloom of his eye, stirring

his firm lips with a sudden tremor and making his touch as soft as it was

strong. For a moment both stood very still, while Debby's tears streamed down

like summer rain; then Frank drew her into the green shadow of the grove, and

its peace soothed her like a mother's voice, till she looked up smiling with a

shy delight her glance had never known before.  The slant sunbeams dropped a

benediction on their heads, the robins peeped, and the cedars whispered, but no

rumor of what further passed ever went beyond the precincts of the wood; for

such hours are sacred, and Nature guards the first blossoms of a human love as

tenderly as she nurses May-flowers underneath the leaves.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll had retired to her bed with a nervous headache, leaving Debby to

the watch and ward of friendly Mrs. Earle, who performed her office finely by

letting her charge entirely alone. In her dreams Aunt Pen was just imbibing a

copious draught of Champagne at the wedding-breakfast of her niece, "Mrs.

Joseph Leavenworth," when she was roused by the bride elect, who passed through

the room with a lamp and a shawl in her hand. <p>



<p>



<p>



"What time is it, and where are you going, dear?" she asked, dozily wondering

if the carriage for the wedding-tour was at the door so soon.<p>



<p>



<p>



"It's only nine, and I am going for a sail, Aunt Pen."<p>



<p>



<p>



As Debby spoke, the light flashed full into her face, and a sudden thought into

Mrs. Carroll's mind. She rose up from her pillow, looking as stately in her

nightcap as Maria Theresa is said to have done in like unassuming head-gear.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Something has happened, Dora! What have you done? What have you said? I insist

upon knowing immediately," she demanded, with somewhat startling brevity.<p>



<p>



<p>



"I have said 'No' to Mr. Leavenworth and 'Yes' to Mr. Evan; and I should like

to go home to-morrow, if you please," was the equally concise reply.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mrs. Carroll fell flat in her bed, and lay there stiff and rigid as Morlena

Kenwigs. Debby gently drew the curtains, and stole away, leaving Aunt Pen's

wrath to effervesce before morning.<p>



<p>



<p>



The moon was hanging luminous and large on the horizon's edge, sending shafts

of light before her till the melancholy ocean seemed to smile, and along that

shining pathway happy Debby and her lover floated into that new world where all

things seem divine.<p></blockquote>

The Media Barons and the Public Interest: An FCC Commissioner's Warning</center></h1> <p>

<blockquote><i><font size=4>The message aside, the medium
may be turning into a quadruple threat, argues Federal Communications
Commissioner Johnson. Local monopolies, regional baronies, nationwide empires,
and corporate conglomerates are more and more in control of the nation's
communications media--newspapers, TV, radio, magazines, books, the electronic
"knowledge industry." The commissioner offers a brief in protest against the
trend and in favor of steps to stop it. At thirty-three, Mr. Johnson already
has one spirited David-Goliath role behind him: the President named him head of
the Maritime Administration in l964, where he fought for shipping industry
reforms over the protests of both management and labor. He became one of the
seven members of the FCC in 1966.</i></font><p>

<font size=5>B</font><font size=3>efore I came to the Federal Communications Commission my concerns about the
ownership of broadcasting and publishing in America were about like those of
any other generally educated person.<p>

<p>

<p>

Most television programming from the three networks struck me as bland at best.
I had taken courses dealing with propaganda and "thought control," bemoaned
(while being entertained by) Time magazine's "slanted" reporting, understood
that Hearst had something to do with the Spanish-American War, and was
impressed with President Eisenhower's concern about "the military-industrial
complex." The changing ownership of the old-line book publishers and the
disappearance of some of our major newspapers made me vaguely uneasy. I was
philosophically wedded to the fundamental importance of "the marketplace of
ideas" in a free society, and a year as law clerk to my idol, Supreme Court
Justice Hugo L. Black, had done nothing to weaken that commitment.<p>

<p>

<p>

But I didn't take much time to be reflective about the current significance of
such matters. It all seemed beyond my ability to influence in any meaningful
way. Then, in July, 1966, I became a member of the FCC. Here my interest in the
marketplace of ideas could no longer remain a casual article of personal faith.
The commitment was an implicit part of the oath I took on assuming the office
of commissioner, and, I quickly learned, an everyday responsibility. <p>

<p>

<p>

Threats to the free exchange of information and opinion in this country can
come from various sources, many of them outside the power of the FCC to affect.
Publishers and reporters are not alike in their ability, education, tolerance
of diversity, and sense of responsibility. The hidden or overt pressures of
advertisers have long been with us.<p>

<p>

<p>

But one aspect of the problem is clearly within the purview of the FCC--the
impact of ownership upon the content of the mass media. It is also a part of
the responsibility of the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. It has
been the subject of recent congressional hearings. There are a number of
significant trends in the ownership of the media worth examining--local and
regional monopolies, growing concentration of control of the most profitable
and powerful television stations in the major markets, broadcasting-publishing
combines, and so forth. But let's begin with a look at the significance of
media ownership by "conglomerate corporations"--holding companies that own, in
addition to publishing and broadcasting enterprises, other major industrial
corporations.<p>

<p>

<p>

During my first month at the FCC I studied the cases and attended the meetings,
but purposefully did not participate in voting on any items. One of the agenda
items at the July 20 commissioners' meeting proposed two draft letters
addressed to the presidents of International Telephone and Telegraph and the
American Broadcasting Company, ITT and ABC, Messrs. Harold Geneen and Leonard
Goldenson. We were asking them to supply "a statement specifying in further
detail the manner in which the financial resources of ITT will enable ABC to
improve its program services and thereby better to serve the public interest."
This friendly inquiry was my first introduction to the proposed ITT-ABC merger,
and the Commission majority's attitudes about it. It was to be a case that
would occupy much of my attention over the next few months.<p>

<p>

<p>

There wasn't much discussion of the letters that morning, but I read carefully
the separate statements filed with the letter by my two responsible and
experienced colleagues, Commissioners Robert T. Bartley and Kenneth A. Cox, men
for whom I was already feeling a respect that was to grow over the following
months.<p>

<p>

<p>

Commissioner Bartley, a former broadcaster with the deep and earthy wisdom one
would expect in a Texas-born relative of the late Speaker Sam Rayburn, wrote a
long and thoughtful statement. He warned of "the probable far-reaching
political, social and economic consequences for the public interest of the
increasing control of broadcast facilities and broadcast service by large
conglomerate corporations such as the applicants." Commissioner Cox, former
lawyer, law professor, counsel to the Senate Commerce Committee, and chief of
the FCC's Broadcast Bureau, characterized the proposed merger as "perhaps the
most important in the agency's history." He said the issues were "so
significant and far-reaching that we should proceed immediately to designate
the matter for hearing."<p>

<p>

<p>

Their concerns were well grounded in broadcasting's history and in the national
debate preceding the 1934 Communications Act we were appointed to enforce.
Precisely what Congress intended the FCC to do was not specified at the time or
since. But no one has ever doubted Congress' great concern lest the ownership
of broadcasting properties be permitted to fall into a few hands or to assume
monopoly proportions.<p>

<p>

<p>

The 1934 Act was preceded by the 1927 Radio Act and a series of industry Radio
Conferences in the early 1920s. The conferences were called by then Secretary
of Commerce Herbert C. Hoover. Hoover expressed concern lest control over
broadcasting "come under the arbitrary power of any person or group of
persons." During the congressional debates on the 1927 Act a leading
congressman, noting that "publicity is the most powerful weapon that can be
wielded in a republic," warned of the domination of broadcasting by "a single
selfish group." Should that happen, he said, "then woe be to those who dare to
differ with them." The requirement that licenses not be transferred without
Commission approval was intended, according to a sponsoring senator, "to
prevent the concentration of broadcast facilities by a few." Thirty years
later, in 1956, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Warren G. Magnuson was still
warning the Commission that it "should be on guard against the intrusion of big
business and absentee ownership."<p>

<p>

<p>

These concerns of Congress and my colleagues were to take on fuller meaning as
the ITT-ABC case unfolded, a case which eventually turned into an FCC cause
celebre. It also demonstrated the enormity of the responsibility vested in this
relatively small and little-known Commission, by virtue of its power to grant
or withhold membership in the broadcast industry. On a personal level, the case
shook into me the realization, for the first time in my life, of the dreadful
significance of the ownership structure of the mass media in America.<p>

<p>

<p>

THE ITT-ABC MERGER CASE<p>

<p>

<p>

"ITT is a sprawling international conglomerate of 433 separate boards of
directors that derives about 60 percent of its income from its significant
holdings in at least forty foreign countries. It is the ninth largest
industrial corporation in the world in size of work force. In addition to its
sale of electronic equipment to foreign governments, and operation of foreign
countries' telephone systems, roughly half of its domestic income comes from
U.S. Government defense and space contracts. But it is also in the business of
consumer finance, life insurance, investment funds, small loan companies, car
rents (ITT- Avis, Inc.), and book publishing."<p>

<p>

<p>

This description of ITT's anatomy is taken (as is much of this ITT-ABC
discussion) from opinions written by myself and Commissioners Bartley and Cox.
We objected, vigorously, to the four-man majority's decision to approve the
merger. So did some senators and congressmen, the Department of Justice, the
Commission's own staff, the American Civil Liberties Union, a number of
independent individuals and witnesses, and a belated but eventually insistent
chorus of newspaper and magazine editorialists.<p>

<p>

<p>

What did we find so ominous about the take-over of this radio and television
network by a highly successful conglomerate organization?<p>

<p>

<p>

In 1966, ABC owned 399 theaters in 34 states, 5 VHF television stations, 6 AM
and 6 FM stations (all in the top 10 broadcasting markets), and, of course, one
of the 3 major television networks and one of the 4 major radio networks in the
world. Its 137 primary television network affiliates could reach 93 percent of
the then 50 million television homes in the United States, and its radio
network affiliates could reach 97 percent of the then 55 million homes with
radio receivers. ABC had interests in, and affiliations with, stations in 25
other nations, known as the "Worldvision Group." These, together with ABC
Films, made the parent corporation perhaps the world's largest distributor of
filmed shows for theaters and television stations throughout this country and
abroad. ABC was heavily involved in the record production and distribution
business, and other subsidiaries published three farm papers.<p>

<p>

<p>

The merger would have placed this accumulation of mass media, and one of the
largest purveyors of news and opinion in America, under the control of one of
the largest conglomerate corporations in the world. What's wrong with that?
Potentially a number of things. For now, consider simply that the integrity of
the news judgment of ABC might be affected by the economic interests of
ITT--that ITT might simply view ABC's programming as a part of ITT's public
relations, advertising, or political activities. This seemed to us a real
threat in 1966, notwithstanding the character of the management of both
companies, and their protestations that no possibility of abuse existed. By
1967 the potential threat had become reality.<p>

<p>

<p>

ITT'S EMPIRE<p>

<p>

<p>

ITT's continuing concern with political and economic developments in foreign
countries as a result of its far-flung economic interests was fully documented
in the hearing. It showed, as one might expect, ITT's recurrent concern with
internal affairs in most major countries of the world, including rate problems,
tax problems, and problems with nationalization and reimbursement, to say
nothing of ordinary commercial dealing. Its involvement with the United States
government, in addition to defense contracts, included the Agency for
International Development's insurance of 5.8 percent of all ITT assets.<p>

<p>

<p>

Testimony was offered on the fascinating story of intrigue surrounding
"Operation Deep Freeze" (an underwater cable). It turned out that ITT
officials, using high-level government contracts in England and Canada, had
brought off a bit of profitable international diplomacy unknown to the United
States State Department or the FCC, possibly in violation of law. Further
inquiry revealed that officers and directors of ITTs subsidiaries included two
members of the British House of Lords, one in the French National Assembly, a
former premier of Belgium, and several ministers of foreign governments and
officials of government-owned companies.<p>

<p>

<p>

As it seemed to Commissioners Bartley and Cox and to me when we dissented from
the Commission's approval of the merger in June, 1967, a company whose daily
activities require it to manipulate governments at the highest levels would
face unending temptation to manipulate ABC news. Any public official, or
officer of a large corporation, is necessarily clearly concerned with the
appearance of some news stories, the absence of others, and the tone and
character of all affecting his personal interests. That's what public relations
firms and press secretaries are all about. We concluded, "We simply cannot find
that the public interest of the American citizenry is served by turning over a
major network to an international enterprise whose fortunes are tied to its
political relations with the foreign officials whose actions it will be called
upon to interpret to the world."<p>

<p>

<p>

Even the highest degree of subjective integrity on the part of chief ITT
officials could not ensure integrity in ABC's operations. To do an honest and
impartial job of reporting the news is difficult enough for the most
independent and conscientious of newsmen. Eric Sevareid has said of putting on
a news program at a network relatively free of conglomerate control: "The
ultimate sensation is the feeling of being bitten to death by ducks." And ABC
newsmen could not help knowing that ITT had sensitive business relations in
various foreign countries and at the highest levels of our government, and that
reporting on any number of industrial and economic developments would touch the
interests of ITT. The mere awareness of these interests would make it
impossible for those news officials, no matter how conscientious, to report
news and develop documentaries objectively, in the way that they would do if
ABC remained unaffiliated with ITT. They would advance within the news
organization, or be fired, or become officers of ABC--perhaps even of ITT--or
not, and no newsman would be able to erase from his mind the idea that his
chances of doing so might be affected by his treatment of issues on which ITT
is sensitive.<p>

<p>

<p>

Only last year CBS was reportedly involved, almost Hearst-like, in a
nightmarish planned armed invasion of Haiti. It was an exclusive, and would
have made a very dramatic start-to-finish documentary but for the inglorious
end: U.S. Customs wouldn't let them leave the United States. Imagine ITT, with
its extensive interests in the Caribbean engaged in such undertakings.<p>

<p>

<p>

The likelihood of at least some compromising of ABC's integrity seemed inherent
in the structure of the proposed new organization. What were the probabilities
that these potentials for abuse would be exercised? We were soon to see the
answer in the bizarre proceedings right before our eyes.<p>

<p>

<p>

During the April, 1967, hearings, while this very issue was being debated, the
Wall Street Journal broke the story that ITT was going to extraordinary lengths
to obtain favorable press coverage of this hearing. Eventually three reporters
were summoned before the examiner to relate for the official record the
incidents that were described in the Journal's expose.<p>

<p>

<p>

An AP and a UPI reporter testified to several phone calls to their homes by ITT
public relations men, variously asking them to change their stories and make
inquiries for ITT with regard to stories by other reporters, and to use their
influence as members of the press to obtain for ITT confidential information
from the Department of Justice regarding its intentions. Even more serious were
several encounters between ITT officials and a New York Times reporter.<p>

<p>

<p>

On one of these occasions ITT's senior vice president in charge of public
relations went to the reporter's office. After criticizing her dispatches to
the Times about the case in a tone which she described as "accusatory and
certainly nasty," he asked whether she had been following the price of ABC and
ITT stock. When she indicated that she had not, he asked if she didn't feel she
had a "responsibility to the shareholders who might lose money as a result of
what" she wrote. She replied, "My responsibility is to find out the truth and
print it."<p>

<p>

<p>

He then asked if she was aware that I (as an FCC Commissioner) was working with
a prominent senator on legislation that would forbid any newspaper from owning
any broadcast property. (The New York Times owns station WQXR in New York.) In
point of fact, the senator and I had never met, let alone collaborated, as was
subsequently made clear in public statements. But the ITT senior vice
president, according to the Times reporter, felt that this false information
was something she "ought to pass on to [her]...publisher before [she
wrote]...anything further" about the case. The obvious implication of this
remark, she felt, was that since the Times owns a radio station, it would want
to consider its economic interests in deciding what to publish about
broadcasting in its newspaper.<p>

<p>

<p>

To me, this conduct, in which at least three ITT officials, including a senior
vice president, were involved, was a deeply unsettling experience. It
demonstrated an abrasive self-righteousness in dealing with the press,
insensitivity to its independence and integrity, a willingness to spread false
stories in furtherance of self-interest, contempt for government officials as
well as the press, and an assumption that even as prestigious a news medium as
the New York Times would, as a matter of course, want to present the news so as
to serve best its own economic interests (as well as the economic interests of
other large business corporations).<p>

<p>

<p>

But for the brazen activities of ITT in this very proceeding, it would never
have occurred to the three of us who dissented to suggest that the most
probable threat to the integrity of ABC news could come from overt actions or
written policy statements. After the hearing it was obvious that that was
clearly possible. But even then we believed that the most substantial threat
came from a far more subtle, almost unconscious, process: that the questionable
story idea, or news coverage, would never even be proposed--whether for reasons
of fear, insecurity, cynicism, realism, or unconscious avoidance.<p>

<p>

<p>

CONCENTRATION OF CONTROL OVER THE MEDIA<p>

<p>

<p>

Since the ITT-ABC case left the Commission I have not ceased to be troubled by
the issues it raised--in many ways more serious (and certainly more prevalent)
for wholly domestic corporations. Eventually the merger was aborted by ITT on
New Year's Day of this year, while the Justice Department's appeal of the
Commission's action was pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals. However, I
ponder what the consequences might have been if ITT's apparent cynicism toward
journalistic integrity had actually been able to harness the enormous social
and propaganda power of a national television network to the service of a
politically sensitive corporate conglomerate. More important, I have become
concerned about the extent to which such forces already play upon important
media of mass communication. Perhaps such attitudes are masked by more finesse
than that displayed in the ITT-ABC case. Perhaps they are even embedded in the
kind of sincere good intentions which caused former Defense Secretary (and
former General Motors president) Charles Wilson to equate the interests of his
company with those of the country.<p>

<p>

<p>

I do not believe that most owners and managers of the mass media in the United
States lack a sense of responsibility or lack tolerance for a diversity of
views. I do not believe there is a small group of men who gather for breakfast
every morning and decide what they will make the American people believe that
day. Emotion often outruns the evidence of those who argue a conspiracy theory
of propagandists' manipulation of the masses.<p>

<p>

<p>

On the other hand, one reason evidence is so hard to come by is that the media
tend to give less publicity to their own abuses than, say, to those of
politicians. The media operate as a check upon other institutional power
centers in our country. There is, however, no check upon the media. Just as it
is a mistake to overstate the existence and potential for abuse, so, in my
judgment, is it a mistake to ignore the evidence that does exist.<p>

<p>

<p>

In 1959, for example, it was reported that officials of the Trujillo regime in
the Dominican Republic had paid $750,000 to officers of the Mutual Radio
Network to gain favorable propaganda disguised as news. (Ownership of the
Mutual Radio Network changed hands once again last year without any review
whatsoever by the FCC of old or new owners. The FCC does not regulate networks,
only stations and Mutual owns none.) RCA was once charged with using an NBC
station to serve unfairly its broader corporate interests, including the
coverage of RCA activities as "news," when others did not. There was
speculation that after RCA acquired Random House, considerable pressure was put
on the book publishing house's president, Bennett Cerf, to cease his Sunday
evening service as a panelist on CBS's What's My Line? The Commission has
occasionally found that individual stations have violated the "fairness
doctrine" in advocating causes serving the station's economic self-interest,
such as pay television.<p>

<p>

<p>

Virtually every issue of the Columbia Journalism Review reports instances of
such abuses by the print media. It has described a railroad-owned newspaper
that refused to report railroad wrecks, a newspaper in debt to the Teamsters
Union which gave exceedingly favorable coverage to Jimmy Hoffa, the repeated
influence of the DuPont interests in the editorial functions of the Wilmington
papers which it owned, and Anaconda Copper's use of its company-owned
newspapers to support political candidates favorable to the company.<p>

<p>

<p>

Edward P. Morgan left ABC last year to become the commentator on the Ford
Foundation-funded Public Broadcasting Laboratory. He has always been
straightforward, and he used his final news broadcast to be reflective about
broadcasting itself. "Let's face it," he said. "We in this trade use this power
more frequently to fix a traffic ticket or get a ticket to a ballgame than to
keep the doors of an open society open and swinging....The freest and most
profitable press in the world, every major facet of it, not only ducks but
pulls its punches to save a supermarket of commercialism or shield an ugly
prejudice and is putting the life of the republic in jeopardy thereby."<p>

<p>

<p>

Economic self-interest does influence the content of the media, and as the
media tend to fall into the control of corporate conglomerates, the areas of
information and opinion affecting those economic interests become dangerously
wide-ranging. What is happening to the ownership of American media today? What
dangers does it pose? Taking a look at the structure of the media in the United
States, I am not put at ease by what I see.<p>

<p>

<p>

Most American communities have far less "dissemination of information from
diverse and antagonistic sources" (to quote a famous description by the Supreme
Court of the basic aim of the First Amendment) than is available nationally. Of
the 1500 cities with daily newspapers, 96 percent are served by single-owner
monopolies. Outside the top 50 to 200 markets there is a substantial dropping
off in the number of competing radio and television signals. The FCC prohibits
a single owner from controlling two AM radio, or two television, stations with
overlapping signals. But it has only recently expressed any concern over common
ownership of an AM radio station and an FM radio station and a television
station in the same market. Indeed, such ownership is the rule rather than the
exception and probably exists in your community. Most stations are today
acquired by purchase. And the FCC has, in part because of congressional
pressure, rarely disapproved a purchase of a station by a newspaper.<p>

<p>

<p>

There are few statewide or regional "monopolies"--although some situations come
close. But in a majority of our states--the least populous--there are few
enough newspapers and television stations to begin with, and they are usually
under the control of a small group. And most politicians find today, as
Congress warned in 1926, "woe be to those who dare to differ with them." Most
of our politics is still state and local in scope. And increasingly, in many
states and local communities, congressmen and state and local officials are
compelled to regard that handful of media owners (many of whom are
out-of-state), rather than the electorate itself, as their effective
constituency. Moreover, many mass media owners have a significant impact in
more than one state. One case that came before the FCC, for example, involved
an owner with AM-FM-TV combinations in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, along with
four newspapers in that state, seven newspapers in Oklahoma, and two stations
and two newspapers in Arkansas. Another involved ownership of ten stations in
North Carolina and adjoining southern Virginia. You may never have heard of
these owners, but I imagine the elected officials of their states return their
phone calls promptly.<p>

<p>

<p>

NATIONAL POWER<p>

<p>

<p>

The principal national sources of news are the wire services, AP and UPI, and
the broadcast networks. Each of the wire services serves on the order of 1200
newspapers and 3000 radio and television stations. Most local newspapers and
radio stations offer little more than wire service copy as far as national and
international news is concerned. To that extent one can take little heart for
"diversity" from the oft-proffered statistics on proliferating radio stations
(now over 6000) and the remaining daily newspapers (1700). The networks, though
themselves heavily reliant upon the wire services to find out what's worth
filming, are another potent force.<p>

<p>

<p>

The weekly newsmagazine field is dominated by Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News.
(The first two also control substantial broadcast, newspaper, and book or
publishing outlets. Time is also in movies (MGM) and is hungry for three or
four newspapers.) Thus, even though there are thousands of general and
specialized periodicals and program sources with significant national or
regional impact, and certainly no "monopoly" exists, it is still possible for a
single individual or corporation to have vast national influence.<p>

<p>

<p>

What we sometimes fail to realize, moreover, is the political significance of
the fact that we have become a nation of cities. Nearly half of the American
people live in the six largest states: California, New York, Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Texas, and Ohio. Those states, in turn, are substantially
influenced (if not politically dominated) by their major
population-industrial-financial-media centers, such as Los Angeles, New York
City, Chicago, and Philadelphia--the nation's four largest metropolitan areas.
Thus, to have a major newspaper or television station influence in one of these
cities is to have significant national power. And the number of interests with
influence in more than one of these markets is startling.<p>

<p>

<p>

Most of the top fifty television markets (which serve approximately 75 percent
of the nation's television homes) have three competing commercial VHF
television stations. There are about 150 such VHF commercial stations in these
markets. Less than 10 percent are today owned by entities that do not own other
media interests. In 30 of the 50 markets at least one of the stations is owned
by a major newspaper published in that market--a total of one third of these
150 stations. (In Dallas Fort Worth each of the network affiliates is owned by
a local newspaper, and the fourth, an unaffiliated station, is owned by
Oklahoma newspapers.) Moreover, half of the newspaper-owned stations are
controlled by seven groups--groups that also publish magazines as popular and
diverse as Time, Newsweek, Look, Parade, Harper's, TV Guide, Family Circle,
Vogue, Good Housekeeping, and Popular Mechanics. Twelve parties own more than
one third of all the major-market stations.<p>

<p>

<p>

In addition to the vast national impact of their affiliates the three
television networks each own VHF stations in all of the top three markets--New
York, Los Angeles, and Chicago--and each has two more in other cities in the
top ten. RKO and Metromedia each own stations in both New York City and Los
Angeles. Metromedia also owns stations in Washington, D.C., and California's
other major city, San Francisco--as well as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland,
Kansas City, and Oakland. RKO also owns stations in Boston, San Francisco,
Washington, Memphis, Hartford, and Windsor, Ontario--as well as the regional
Yankee Network. Westinghouse owns stations in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia
and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Boston, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Fort Wayne.
These are but a few examples of today's media barons.<p>

<p>

<p>

There are many implications of their power. Groups of stations are able to
bargain with networks, advertisers, and talent in ways that put lesser stations
at substantial economic disadvantage. Group ownership means, by definition,
that few stations in major markets will be locally owned. (The FCC recently
approved the transfer of the last available station in San Francisco to the
absentee ownership of Metromedia. The only commercial station locally owned
today is controlled by the San Francisco Chronicle.) But the basic point is
simply that the national political power involved in ownership of a group of
major VHF television stations in, say, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and
Washington, D.C., is greater than a democracy should unthinkingly repose in one
man or corporation.<p>

<p>

<p>

CONGLOMERATE CORPORATIONS<p>

<p>

<p>

For a variety of reasons, an increasing number of communications media are
turning up on the organization charts of conglomerate companies. And the
incredible profits generated by broadcast stations in the major markets
(television broadcasters average a 90 to 100 percent return on tangible
investment annually) have given FCC licensees, particularly owners of multiple
television stations like the networks, Metromedia, Storer Broadcasting, and
others, the extra capital with which to buy the New York Yankees (CBS), Random
House (RCA), or Northeast Airlines (Storer). Established or up-and-coming
conglomerates regard communications acquisitions as prestigious, profitable,
and often a useful or even a necessary complement to present operations and
projected exploitation of technological change.<p>

<p>

<p>

The national problem of conglomerate ownership of communications media was well
illustrated by the ITT-ABC case. But the conglomerate problem need not involve
something as large as ITT-ABC or RCA-NBC. Among the national group owners of
television stations are General Tire (RKO), Avco, Westinghouse, Rust Craft,
Chris Craft, Kaiser, and Kerr-McGee. The problem of local conglomerates was
forcefully posed for the FCC in another case earlier this year. Howard Hughes,
through Hughes Tool Company, wanted to acquire one of Las Vegas' three major
television stations. He had recently acquired $125 million worth of Las Vegas
real estate, including hotels, gambling casinos, and an airport. These
investments supplemented 27,000 acres previously acquired. The Commission
majority blithely approved the television acquisition without a hearing,
overlooking FCC precedents which suggested that a closer examination was in
order. In each of these instances the potential threat is similar to that in
the ITT-ABC case--that personal economic interests may dominate or bias
otherwise independent media.<p>

<p>

<p>

CONCENTRATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE<p>

<p>

<p>

The problem posed by conglomerate acquisitions of communications outlets is
given a special but very important twist by the pendency of sweeping
technological changes which have already begun to unsettle the structure of the
industry.<p>

<p>

<p>

President Johnson has appointed a distinguished task force to evaluate our
national communications policy and chart a course for realization of these
technological promises in a manner consistent with the public interest. But
private interests have already begun to implement their own plans on how to
deal with the revolution in communications technology.<p>

<p>

<p>

General Sarnoff of RCA has hailed the appearance of "the knowledge
industry"--corporate casserole dishes blending radio and television stations,
networks, and programming; films, movie houses, and record companies;
newspaper, magazine, and book publishing; advertising agencies; sports or other
entertainment companies; and teaching machines and other profitable
appurtenances of the $50 billion "education biz."<p>

<p>

<p>

And everybody's in "cable television"--networks, book publishers, newspapers.
Cable television is a system for building the best TV antenna in town and then
wiring it into everybody's television set--for a fee. It improves signal
quality and number of channels, and has proved popular. But the new technology
is such that it has broadcasters and newspaper publishers worried. For the same
cable that can bring off-the-air television into the home can also bring
programming from the cable operator's studio, or an "electronic newspaper"
printed in the home by a facsimile process. Books can be delivered (between
libraries, or to the home) over "television" by using the station's signal
during an invisible pause. So everybody's hedging their bets--including the
telephone company. Indeed, about all the vested interests can agree upon is
that none of them want us to have direct, satellite-to-home radio and
television. But at this point it is not at all clear who will have his hand on
the switch that controls what comes to the American people over their
"telephone wire" a few years hence.<p>

<p>

<p>

WHAT IS TO BE DONE?<p>

<p>

<p>

It would be foolish to expect any extensive restructuring of the media in the
United States, even if it were considered desirable. Technological change can
bring change in structure, but it is as likely to be change to even greater
concentration as to wider diversity. In the short run at least, economics seems
to render essentially intractable such problems as local monopolies in daily
newspapers, or the small number of outlets for national news through wire
services, newsmagazines, and the television networks. Indeed, to a certain
extent the very high technical quality of the performance rendered by these
news-gathering organizations is aided by their concentration of resources into
large units and the financial cushions of oligopoly profits.<p>

<p>

<p>

Nevertheless, it seems clear to me that the risks of concentration are grave.<p>

Chairman Philip Hart of the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee remarked
by way of introduction to his antitrust subcommittee's recent hearings about
the newspaper industry, "The products of newspapers, opinion and information,
are essential to the kind of society that we undertake to make successful
here." If we are serious about the kind of society we have undertaken, it is
clear to me that we simply must not tolerate concentration of media
ownership--except where concentration creates actual countervailing social
benefits. These benefits cannot be merely speculative. They must be
identifiable, demonstrable, and genuinely weighty enough to offset the dangers
inherent in concentration.<p>

<p>

<p>

This guideline is a simple prescription. The problem is to design and build
machinery to fill it. And to keep the machinery from rusting and rotting. And
to replace it when it becomes obsolete.<p>

<p>

<p>

America does have available governmental machinery which is capable of
scotching undue accumulations of power over the mass media, at least in theory
and to some extent. The Department of Justice has authority under the antitrust
laws to break up combinations which "restrain trade" or which "tend to lessen
competition." These laws apply to the media as they do to any other industry.<p>

<p>

<p>

But the antitrust laws simply do not get to where the problems are. They grant
authority to block concentration only when it threatens economic competition in
a particular economic market. Generally, in the case of the media, the relevant
market is the market for advertising. Unfortunately, relatively vigorous
advertising competition can be maintained in situations where competition in
the marketplace of ideas is severely threatened. In such cases, the Justice
Department has little inclination to act.<p>

<p>

<p>

Look at the Chicago Tribune's recent purchase of that city's most popular and
most successful FM radio station. The Tribune already controlled two Chicago
newspapers, one (clear channel) AM radio station, and the city's only
independent VHF television station. It controls numerous broadcast, CATV, and
newspaper interests outside Chicago (in terms of circulation, the nation's
largest newspaper chain). But, after an investigation, the Antitrust Division
let this combination go through. The new FM may be a needless addition to the
Tribune's already impressive battery of influential media; it could well
produce an unsound level of concentration in the production and supply of what
Chicagoans see, read, and hear about affairs in their community, in the nation,
and in the world. But it did not threaten the level of competition for
advertising money in any identifiable advertising market. So, it was felt, the
acquisition was not the business of the Justice Department.<p>

<p>

<p>

Only the FCC is directly empowered to keep media ownership patterns compatible
with a democracy's need for diversified sources of opinion and information.<p>

<p>

<p>

In earlier times, the Commission took this responsibility very seriously. In
1941, the FCC ordered NBC to divest itself of one of its two radio networks
(which then became ABC), barring any single network from affiliating with more
than one outlet in a given city. (The Commission has recently waived this
prohibition for, ironically, ABC's four new national radio networks.) In 1941
the Commission also established its power to set absolute limits on the total
number of broadcast licenses any individual may hold, and to limit the number
of stations any individual can operate in a particular service area.<p>

<p>

<p>

The American people are indebted to the much maligned FCC for establishing
these rules. Imagine, for example, what the structure of political power in
this country might look like if two or three companies owned substantially all
of the broadcast media in our major cities.<p>

<p>

<p>

But since the New Deal generation left the command posts of the FCC, this
agency has lost much of its zeal for combating concentration. Atrophy has
reached so advanced a state that the public has of late witnessed the bizarre
spectacle of the Justice Department, with its relatively narrow mandate,
intervening in FCC proceedings, such as ITT-ABC, to create court cases with
names like The United States vs. The FCC.<p>

<p>

<p>

This history is an unhappy one on the whole. It forces one to question whether
government can ever realistically be expected to sustain a vigilant posture
over an industry which controls the very access of government officials
themselves to the electorate.<p>

<p>

<p>

I fear that we have already reached the point in this country where the media,
our greatest check on other accumulations of power, may themselves be beyond
the reach of any other institution: the Congress, the President, or the Federal
Communications Commission, not to mention governors, mayors, state legislators,
and city councilmen. Congressional hearings are begun and then quietly dropped.
Whenever the FCC stirs fitfully as if in wakefulness, the broadcasting industry
scurries up the Hill for a congressional bludgeon. And the fact that roughly 60
percent of all campaign expenses go to radio and television time gives but a
glimmer of the power of broadcasting in the lives of senators and
congressmen.<p>

<p>

<p>

However, the picture at this moment has its more hopeful aspect. There does
seem to be an exceptional flurry of official concern. Even the FCC has its
proposed rulemaking outstanding. The Department of Justice, having broken into
the communications field via its dramatic intervention before the FCC in the
ITT-ABC merger case, has also been pressing a campaign to force the dissolution
of joint operating agreements between separately owned newspapers in individual
cities, and opposed a recent application for broadcasting properties by
newspaper interests in Beaumont, Texas. It has been scrutinizing crossmedia
combinations linking broadcasting, newspaper, and cable television outlets. On
Capitol Hill, Senator Phil Hart's Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee and
Chairman Harley Staggers' House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee have
both summoned the Federal Communications Commission to appear before them in
recent months, to acquaint the Commission with the committees' concern about
FCC-approved increases in broadcast holdings by single individuals and
companies, and about cross-ownership of newspapers, CATV systems, and broadcast
stations. Representatives John Dingell, John Moss, and Richard Ottinger have
introduced legislation which would proscribe network ownership of any
nonbroadcast interests. And as I previously mentioned, President Johnson has
appointed a task force to undertake a comprehensive review of national
communications policy.<p>

<p>

<p>

Twenty years ago Robert M. Hutchins, then chancellor of the University of
Chicago, was named chairman of the "Commission on Freedom of the Press." It
produced a thoughtful report, full of recommendations largely applicable
today--including "the establishment of a new and independent [nongovernmental]
agency to appraise and report annually upon the performance of the press," and
urged "that the members of the press engage in vigorous mutual criticism." Its
proposals are once again being dusted off and reread.<p>

<p>

<p>

What is needed now, more than anything else, is to keep this flurry of interest
alive, and to channel it toward constructive reforms. What this means, in
practical fact, is that concern for media concentration must find an
institutional home.<p>

<p>

<p>

The Department of Justice has already illustrated the value of participation by
an external institution in FCC decision-making. The developing concept of a
special consumers' representative offers a potentially broader base for similar
action.<p>

<p>

<p>

But the proper place to lodge continuing responsibility for promoting diversity
in the mass media is neither the FCC nor the Justice Department nor a
congressional committee. The initiative must come from private sources. Plucky
Nader-like crusaders such as John Banzhaf (who single-handedly induced the FCC
to apply the "fairness" doctrine to cigarette commercials) have shown how
responsive government can be to the skillful and vigorous efforts of even a
lone individual. But there are more adequately staffed and funded private
organizations which could play a more effective role in policy formation than a
single individual. Even the FCC, where the public interest gets entirely too
little representation from private sources, has felt the impact of the United
Church of Christ, with its interest in the influence of broadcasting on race
relations and in the programming responsibility of licensees, and of the
American Civil Liberties Union, which submitted a brief in the ITT-ABC case.<p>

<p>

<p>

Ideally, however, the resources for a sustained attack on concentration might
be centered in a single institution, equipped to look after this cause with the
kind of determination and intelligence that the Ford Foundation and the
Carnegie Corporation, for example, have brought to bear in behalf of the cause
of public broadcasting and domestic satellites. The law schools and their law
reviews, as an institution, have performed well in this way for the courts, but
have virtually abdicated responsibility for the agencies.<p>

<p>

<p>

Such an organization could devote itself to research as well as representation.
For at present any public body like the FCC, which has to make determinations
about acceptable levels of media concentration, has to do so largely on the
basis of hunch. In addition, private interest in problems of concentration
would encourage the Justice Department to sustain its present vigilance in this
area. It could stimulate renewed vigilance on the part of the FCC, through
participation in Commission proceedings. And it could consider whether new
legislation might be appropriate to reach the problem of
newspaper-magazine-book publishing combinations.<p>

<p>

<p>

If changes are to be made (or now dormant standards are to be enforced) the
most pressing political question is whether to apply the standards
prospectively only, or to require divestiture. It is highly unlikely, to say
the least, that legislation requiring massive divestiture of multiple station
ownership, or newspaper ownership of stations, would ever pass through
Congress. Given the number of station sales every year, however, even
prospective standards could have some impact over ten years or so.<p>

<p>

<p>

In general, I would urge the minimal standard that no accumulation of media
should be permitted without a specific and convincing showing of a continuing
countervailing social benefit. For no one has a higher calling in an
increasingly complex free society bent on self-government than he who informs
and moves the people. Personal prejudice, ignorance, social pressure, and
advertiser pressure are in large measure inevitable. But a nation that has, in
Learned Hand's phrase, "staked its all" upon the rational dialogue of an
informed electorate simply cannot take any unnecessary risk of polluting the
stream of information and opinion that sustains it. At the very least, the
burden of proving the social utility of doing otherwise should be upon him who
seeks the power and profit which will result.<p>

<p>

<p>

Whatever may be the outcome, the wave of renewed interest in the impact of
ownership on the role of the media in our society is healthy. All will gain
from intelligent inquiry by Congress, the Executive, the regulatory
commissions--and especially the academic community, the American people
generally, and the media themselves. For, as the Supreme Court has noted,
nothing is more important in a free society than "the widest possible
dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources." And if we
are unwilling to discuss this issue fully today we may find ourselves
discussing none that matter very much tomorrow.<p></blockquote>

<p><a name="ABSTRACT"><b>ABSTRACT</b></a> </p>
<p>The use of endocardial screw-in electrodes in permanent pacemaker implants is becoming increasingly popular for multiple 
reasons. This study compares a new steroid eluting, titanium nitride coated, retractable screw-in permanent pacing lead to an 
identical non-steroid eluting, non-coated lead. Using a 3:1 randomization for atrial and ventricular leads favoring the study lead 
(Pacesetter 1388T) vs the control lead (Pacesetter 1188T), patients were implanted in a standard fashion at 35 centers. 
Evaluation of the leads was performed at implant using a pacing system analyzer. They were then evaluated using the 
pacemaker telemetry immediately post implant and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. The study included 521 
leads in 303 patients over a 6 month period.. For both atrial and ventricular leads, capture and sensing thresholds were 
significantly better for the study lead. In addition, and in contrast to the control lead, little to no &quot;peaking&quot; of the capture 
threshold occurred. Lead impedance was significantly lower for the study leads than for the control. In conclusion, excellent 
electrical characteristics were documented acutely and through the first 3 months of follow-up with the steroid eluting lead. 
Data at the 6 month follow-up is not significant due to small sample size at this time. </p>
<p><a name="INTRODUCTION"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a> </p>
<p>Endocardial screw-in leads have provided a significant advancement in cardiac pacing therapy. The active fixation design has 
generally reduced the incidence of lead dislodgment <a href="#FOOTNOTE_1">[1]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_2">[2]</a> and provided an easy to achieve and stable contact with the 
endocardium <a href="#FOOTNOTE_3">[3]</a>. The anatomical placement of the electrode is not limited, allowing identification of the best electrical location 
within the cardiac chamber <a href="#FOOTNOTE_4">[4]</a>, and the best position to achieve optimal physiology. Additionally, the design of active fixation 
leads facilitates the easy repositioning of the electrode location if this is required <a href="#FOOTNOTE_5">[5]</a>. The isodiametric nature of these leads 
relative to passive fixation designs may facilitate their removal as well. </p>
<p>The concern regarding endocardial screw-in leads has generally been related to chronic thresholds <a href="#FOOTNOTE_2">[2]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_3">[3]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_6">[6]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_7">[7]</a>. The fixation 
screw traumatizes the endomyocardium at the site of screw penetration <a href="#FOOTNOTE_6">[6]</a>. This trauma, in combination with the relative 
stiffness and tip weight of the screw-in lead versus a passive fixation lead, may lead to elevated chronic pacing thresholds. 
However, some research has shown little difference in pacing or sensing characteristics <a href="#FOOTNOTE_8">[8]</a>. </p>
<p>The benefits of utilizing a steroid compound in passive fixation pacing leads has been reported extensively in the literature <a href="#FOOTNOTE_7">[7]</a> 
<a href="#FOOTNOTE_9">[9]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_10">[10]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_11">[11]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_12">[12]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_13">[13]</a>. Limited data has been published on the potential benefits of steroid in endocardial screw-in leads7 . 
The results of a multicenter prospectively randomized trial intended to identify the comparative performance of a new 
endocardial screw-in lead to a similar control lead without steroid are presented in this study. The performance of the leads 
was evaluated in both atrial and ventricular applications. </p>
<p><a name="METHODS AND MATERIALS"><b>METHODS AND MATERIALS</b></a></p>
<p>The new study lead was the Model 1388T Tendril DX pacing lead (Pacesetter Systems, Sylmar, CA). This lead is of coaxial 
design and incorporates an 8.5 mm2 electrically active helix cathodal electrode with a microporous titanium nitride coating to 
facilitate sensing and reduce electrode polarization. The titanium nitride material is a porous conductive ceramic which 
increases the surface area on a microscopic scale. The 34 mm2 ring electrode is also coated with this material and the 
electrical dipole is 1.0 cm. The core material of both electrodes is platinum iridium. The steroid (maximum 1 mg. 
dexamethasone sodium phosphate) is contained within a silicone matrix which is positioned within the helix assembly. As the 
helix is extended and penetrates the myocardium, the steroid impregnated matrix is moved against the endocardium for 
gradual steroid elution. The helix is extended by turning the internal coil of the lead using a tool. Inner and outer lead insulation 
is silicone rubber. The outer insulation has a hydromer coating to facilitate passage within the vessel. </p>
<p>The control lead was the Pacesetter Model 1188T lead. The lead is identical to the 1388T study lead in all aspects except for 
the steroid matrix, and the titanium nitride coating of the screw and anodal ring electrodes. </p>
<p><b>Study Design:</b> <br>
The Model 1388T study lead was prospectively randomized in a 3:1 fashion to the non-steroid version without titanium nitride 
(Model 1188T). Typical electrical characterization measurements were made at implant including capture thresholds at a pulse 
duration of 0.4 ms, sensing thresholds and pacing impedance. All testing was conducted in both unipolar and bipolar 
configurations. A standard Pacing System Analyzer was used for initial implant testing. The implanted pacemaker and the 
external programming system (APS II, Pacesetter Systems, Sylmar CA) was used to evaluate the electrical values 
immediately post implant and for all chronic testing. The same electrical characteristics were measured at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 
months and 6 months post implant. All system and patient complications were recorded during the study period. The study 
electrode was evaluated both in the atrial and ventricular applications. Electrical characteristics were compared using the 
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Pacing impedance was evaluated using a non-paired Student's T-Test. </p>
<p><a name="RESULTS"><b>RESULTS</b></a></p>
<p>The multicenter evaluation included 35 centers within the United States and involved 303 patients implanted with 521 leads. 
The study began on 8/23/95 and includes follow-up through 3/15/96. The mean follow-up of leads during this study was 110 
days (range 1 - 205). The utilization of leads in atrial and ventricular applications is provided in Table I. </p>

<p>The patient population reflected the general pacing population with a mean age of 70 years (&#177;14), with 66% of the study 
group male. The indication for device implantation was sinus node disease in 50% of patients and heart block in 42%. 90% of 
the leads were implanted via the subclavian approach. </p>
<p>Atrial capture thresholds were found to be significantly lower in the study group than the control through 3 months of 
follow-up (Figure 1A). Statistical significance was not achieved at six months due to the small sample size. The bipolar mean 
capture threshold for the steroid group never rose above 1.0V while the control group peaked at 2.6V at the 2 week 
follow-up. At the 3 month evaluation the steroid lead provided a mean bipolar capture threshold of 1.0V compared to the 
control capture threshold of 2.0V. Unipolar atrial and ventricular threshold testing showed similar performance. Atrial sensing 
was observed to have no statistical difference at implant, but statistically improved for the study group at all follow-ups (Figure 
2A) except at 6 months due to insufficient sample size. The mean bipolar P wave amplitude of the steroid group was 3.2mV 
at 3 months compared to 2.1mV for the control lead. Atrial pacing impedance was observed to be lower in the study group 
(Figure 3) with a mean bipolar impedance of 404 Ohms at 3 months as compared to a mean of 516 Ohms for the control 
group (p=.00001, non paired T-test). </p>

<p>Ventricular capture thresholds were also found to be significantly lower in the steroid group than the control (Figure 1A). 
Statistical significance was again not achieved at six months due to the small sample size. The bipolar mean capture threshold 
did not exceed 1.0V in the steroid population while the mean capture threshold in the control group peaked at 2.8V at the 2 
week follow-up. At the 3 month evaluation the steroid lead provided a mean bipolar capture threshold of 1.0V compared to 
the control capture threshold of 2.3V. Again, the results of unipolar testing showed similar results. Ventricular sensing trended 
toward improvement in the study group (Figure 2B), but only reached statistical significance at the two week evaluation 
(8.0mV vs 6.9mV, p=.0084). Ventricular pacing impedance was observed to be lower in the steroid group (Figure 3) at all 
follow-ups (485 Ohms versus 595 Ohms bipolar impedance at the 3 month follow-up p=.00001). </p>
<p>Fifteen lead related complications (2.9%) were reported in 14 patients (4.6%). Mean time to complication was 5.7 days 
(range 0 - 16). No statistical difference was detected (Fisher's exact test, 2-Tailed) in the proportion of lead related 
complications between the study and control leads (2.9% versus 3.3% respectively). Clinical observations are summarized in 
Table II. Corrective actions included lead repositioning (7), device reprogramming (5) and lead replacement (3). Two of the 
above complications were reported to be related to lead perforation. In addition to these complications, 2 leads were 
electively replaced due to low lead impedance and 1 due to possible conductor coil damage as viewed fluoroscopically. None 
of these leads revealed a clinically functional problem. </p>

<p><font size=2>*High Threshold group did not clinically show loss of capture, but were identified at follow-up to have elevated capture threshold. <br>
</font></p>
<p><a name="DISCUSSION"><b>DISCUSSION</b></a></p>
<p>There are many potential advantages to using isodiametric active fixation leads. The data accumulated over the course of this 
study demonstrates that active fixation leads are capable of achieving capture thresholds comparable to passive fixation leads. 
The one question that is not answered in this study is how much of the improvement is due to steroid vs. the titanium nitride 
coating. </p>
<p>The pacing impedance of the study lead was approximately 20% lower than that of the control lead, presumably due to the 
increased surface area from the titanium nitride coating. Though this results in an increased current delivery, the dramatically 
lower energy threshold achieved allows for significant energy savings through programming of lower outputs and pulse widths. 
In conclusion, the 1388T lead provides significantly improved pacing performance as compared to a similar pacing lead 
without steroid and titanium nitride coating. </p>

<p><a name="SUMMARY"><b>SUMMARY</b></a> </p>
<p>Special functions and data storage increase the energy consumption of pacemakers. The most efficient way to decrease the 
current drain without an increase in threshold is to decrease the electrode size while mitigating tissue injury. Bipolar Capsure Z 
is a tined lead with a 1,2 mm<sup>2 </sup>porous, platinized, steroid eluting distal cathode. 96 Capsure Z leads (42 atrial) have been 
implanted in 54 patients. At 0.5 ms the mean acute threshold were 0.6 &#177; 0.2 V at the atrium and 0.2 &#177; 0.03 V at the ventricle. 
Means acute impedance were 1100 &#177; 300 ohms and 1360 &#177; 250 ohms, respectively. Mean acute P wave was 2.6 &#177; 1.3 mV 
and mean R wave was 18 &#177; 6 mV. In 15 patients ventricular impedance was under 1000 ohms and remain there after 
repositioning the lead in 5. During follow-up thresholds was 0.1 ms at 0.5 V at the ventricle in 96 % of the cases and at 1 V at 
the atrium in 94 % of the patients. Impedance seemed to decrease during the chronic follow-up. The six-month impedance 
was 810 &#177; 180 ohms in the atrium and 1040 &#177; 210 ohms in the ventricle. Our results clearly verifies that a high impedance 
lead with steroid elution at the tip offers very low acute and chronic thresholds and so stable that it could be possible to pace 
the atrium using a pulse duration of 0.5 ms at 1 V amplitude in 94 % of the p&agrave;tients. In the ventricle, 0.5 V and 0.5 ms is 
possible in 96 % of the patients. The mean energy supplied chronically in the patients of this study was 2.3 to 1.1 microJ for 
the atrial lead and 1 to 0.4 microJ for the ventricular leads. In these circumpstances, the amount of energy (or current) used to 
pace the patient is extremelly small. This leaves most of the battery current capacity to allow for the implementation of more 
functions and diagnostic tools. This clearly shows that a new standard in pacing has evolved. </p>

<p><a name="INTRODUCTION"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a> </p>
<p>Special functions and data storage increase the energy consumption (current drain) of pacemakers. This can result in 
decreased longevity and/or larger pulse generator size. Higher capacity batteries can extend longevity, but this increases pulse 
generator size. Alternatevily, low current drain leads can help compensate for this increase. Current drain decreases as the 
square of the output voltage. Output voltage can only be reduced if threshold are low enough to permit an adequate safety 
factor. Meticulous surgical procedure is essential for obtaining optimum low threshold and intracardiac signals. Previous work 
demonstrates that steroid-eluting leads maintain low chronic thresholds because of decreased endo/myocardial damage <a href="#FOOTNOTE_1">[1]</a>. 
According to Ohm&#146;s law, current is directly related to voltage and inversely related to resistance (impedance). In a pacing 
circuit, impedance has several components. Some, as the tissue and lead conductor resistance, can be modeled as simple 
resistances. Others, such as the electrode-tissue interface, are complex and poorly understood. If pacing impedance is high, 
then current drain will be reduced, but the way impedance is distributed in the circuit can affect thresholds. High conductor 
resistance causes thresholds to increase because of the way voltage is divided within the circuit <a href="#FOOTNOTE_2">[2]</a> losing most of the pacing 
energy in the form of heat. The most efficient way to decrease the current drain without an increase in threshold is to decrease 
the electrode size (geometric surface area) while mitigating tissue injury, due to inflammation, with optimum surface and steroid 
elution <a href="#FOOTNOTE_3">[3]</a> (Figure 1). </p>

<p><a name="MATERIAL and METHODS"><b>MATERIAL and METHODS</b> </a></p>
<p>A bipolar tined lead with a 1,2 mm<sup>2</sup> porous, platinized, steroid eluting distal cathode (Capsure Z, Figure 2) was used in the 
study. The insulation material is silicone rubber with a plasma treated surface to enhance lubricity. It has four, 3 mm long 
silicone rubber tines. The lead fits easily through a 9 french introducer. The electrode contains a maximum of 1 mg of 
dexamethasone sodium phosphate in a silicone rubber compound. The lead&#146;s conductor resistance is 46 ohms unipolar and 
95 ohms bipolar. </p>
<p><img src="Images/p0013f2.gif" align=bottom width=175 height=240><br>
<font size=2><b>Fig. 2 </b>Capsure SP introduced in 1991 have a tip diameter of 5.8 mm</font><sup><font size=2>2</font></sup><font size=2>. Diameter of Capsure Z have been decreased to only 1.2 mm</font><sup><font size=2>2</font></sup><font size=2>. Its 
microporous and steroid eluting properties made possible a very low thresholds and excellent sensing capabilities <br>
</font></p>
<p>Beginning in June 1995, 96 Capsure Z leads have been implanted in 54 patients (24 females). The patient population had a 
mean age of 56 &#177; 23 years (range 27-78). Forty two of the implants were atrial. These included 3 with a preshaped distal &#147;J&#148;. 
The remaining 39 atrial implants used &#147;straight&#148; ventricular leads. In the ventricle, 53 were bipolar, 1 was unipolar. The 12 
patients who recieved a single ventricular lead were in atrial fibrillation with a high degree AV block. The main diagnosis was 
AV block in 18 patients of the dual chamber implants, and different degrees of sinus node dysfunction in the rest. </p>
<p>Local anesthesia was applied before scrubbing. The skin incission was located in the opposite side of the dominant hand of 
the patient. A subcutameous pocket was developed for pulse generator placement. All leads were inserted by subclavian 
puncture technique (double if two leads were to be implanted). Once the guide wire is into the vein a non-absorbable suture 
was double passed around it twice to prevent lead kicking. </p>
<p>The ventricular lead was always passed to the pulmonary artery and then pulled back to the ventricle. This was accomplished 
by introducing a straight stylet to the left border of the spine before retracting the lead. When a dual chamber device was 
implanted, retraction of the ventricular lead from the pulmonary artery was accomplished after placement of the atrial lead. 
Placement of the ventricular lead in the right pulmonary artery gives an anatomical landmark for the situation of right atrial 
appendage. Once the tip of the lead was in the right ventricle, pointing to the left hemidiaphram, it was advanced with the 
stylet just 1 cm back from the tip. &#147;Straight&#148; leads for atrial placement were advanced with a &#147;J&#148; shaped stylet. Once the distal 
tip was in the right atrial appendage (producing a lateral &#147;to and from&#148; movements) the lead was advanced over the 
&#147;stationary&#148; stylet. When the lead could not be advanced any more, the stylet was carefully removed. If the tip was well 
engaged, the lead retained a &#147;J&#148; shape. If not well placed, the lead would straighten and dislodge. After obtaining a good 
position through radiological criteria, acute bipolar pacing and sensing tests were done with the aid of a Medtronic 5311B 
PSA. After the initial cases, the first step in acute testing was to pace at 100 bpm and measure bipolar lead impedance. When 
this was lower than 1200 ohms, the position of the lead was modified until this value (or greater) was obtained. If after 3-4 
attemps, the impedance criterion was not reached, the position with the previous highest value was looked for. The amplitude 
and slew rate were measured. The unfiltered R or P wave was printed. Next, pacing at the highest output was done to test 
stimulation of the phrenic nerve or the diaphragm. Thresholds measurements were left for the end of the procedure. 
Thresholds were measured at 0.5 ms, increasing output out of 0.1 V to capture in the ventricle, beginning at 0.5 V at the 
atrium. Leads were fixed at the pectoral muscle fascia. The arm was immobilized during the first 36 hours to avoid any 
microdislodging of the lead tip. </p>
<p>Follow-up measurements were taken after 3 days, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months. First, the telemetered measured data were 
obtained and printed. If the diagnostic data were available, then they were interrogated and printed. Then voltage tresholds 
were measured automatically in all devices., first at 0.5 -0.6 ms, then with the lowest available pulse width. If possible, the 
pulse width threshold was measured at 0.5 V. </p>
<p><a name="RESULTS"><b>RESULTS</b></a> </p>
<p><b>Acute results</b> <br>
During the first few implants, our usual monitoring procedures were used. Threshold and sensing were measured, then 
impedance recorded. The mean acute atrial threshold at 0.5 ms was 0.6 &#177; 0.2 V. The mean current at threshold was 0.5 &#177; 
0.3 mA for an acute atrial impedance (MAI) of 1100 &#177; 300 ohms. In the ventricle, acute thresholds was 0.2 &#177; 0.03 V with 
0.19 &#177; 0.06 mA for an impedance of 1360 &#177; 250 ohms. The mean acute P wave amplitude was 2.6 &#177; 1.3 mV with a slew 
rate of 0.87 &#177; 0.33 V/s. The mean R wave amplitude was 18 &#177; 6 mV with a 2.2 &#177; 0.41 V/s slew rate. It was evident from 
the beginning that the &#147;normal&#148; acute ventricular threshold for Capture Z is 0.2 V at 0.5 ms. Several initial impedance 
measurements were less than 1000 ohms. Most cases with acute threshold higher than 0.2 V had impedances under 1000 
ohms. From these facts, the monitoring procedure was modified to measure lead impedance first. If its value was not 1200 
ohms or higher, the position of the the lead was modified and the impedance remeasured. In 15 patients, repositioning was 
continued for a minimum of three or four times looking for high impedance. In 5 cases, the final impedance was not higher than 
the obtained on the first try (Figure 3). </p>
<p><img src="Images/p0013f3.gif" align=bottom width=240 height=150><br>
<font size=2><b>Fig. 3 </b>Repositioning the ventricular lead in 15 patients with lead impedance under 1000 ohms improves ventricular threshold and increase 
impedance in 10 patients. Looking-for a position with as high impedance as possible is recommendable<br>
</font></p>
<p>We found that if the lead was looping in the heart, straightening it usually (but not always) increased impedance. In a very few 
cases, the opposite was true. An acute impedance lower than 1000 ohms was accepted in 8 addtional patients because the 
threshold was 0.2 V at 0.5 ms. The pacing impedance at the atrium was typically lower than in the ventricle, but acute pacing 
thresholds was also much lower than with other leads. There was not a clear relationship between repositioning of the lead 
and modification of the pacing impedance and/or threshold at the atrium. There is a tendency (not analyzed statistically 
bacause it is a study in progress) that when the R wave electrogram, obtained from the PSA, had a lower slew rate and a 
flattened repolarization part of the wave, we had pacing impedance lower than 1200 ohms in the ventricle (Figure 4). The 
same appears to be true at the atrial level. In 9 of the 11 cases where repositioning produced an increase in pacing 
impedance, the new R wave tended to have a higher slew rate and a non-flattened shape (Figure4). In 5 patients where 
repositioning did not result in an increase of pacing impedance, there was also no significant modification of the R wave. The 
final threshold at 0.5 ms in these 5 patients was 0.2 V (N=2) to 0.3 V (N=3). which is within the instrumental error. The 
unipolar results of the ventricular or preshaped &#147;J&#148; leads in the atrium were not analyzed because there were too few cases. <br>

<p><b>Follow - up results</b> <br>
During follow-up ventricular thresholds at 0.5 V was 0.1 ms in 96 % of the cases. The atrial thresholds at 1 V was 0.1 ms in 
94 % of the patients (Figure 5). Only two patients showed a ventricular pacing threshold higher than 0.5 V (0.9 and 1.1 V) 
without any apparent explanation. One patient had a 1.5 V threshold in the atrium. The atrial output was programmed to 1.5 
V and 0.5 ms in 39 patients and the ventricular output to 1 V and 0.5 ms in 50 patients. <br>
</p>
<p><font size=2><b><img src="Images/p0013f5.gif" align=bottom width=240 height=200><br>
Fig. 5 </b>The very low chronic thresholds of Capsure Z leads made possible to pace the atrium chronically at 1V-0.5ms at the atrium in 94% of the 
patients and to 0.5 V-0.5 ms in 96% at the ventricle with a safety margin between 2:5and 5:1 since the chronic threshold is 0.1-0.2 ms at such 
outputs<br>
</font></p>
<p>Impedance seemed to decrease during the chronic follow-up. As compared to the initial implant values of 1100 ohms in the 
atrium and 1360 ohms in the ventricle, the one-month impedance was 815 &#177; 170 ohms in the atrium and 1075 &#177; 250 ohms in 
the ventricle. The 3 and 6 month follow up also followed this pattern being 830 &#177; 150 ohms and 810 &#177; 180 ohms in the 
atrium and 1030 &#177; 200 ohms and 1040 &#177; 210 ohms in the ventricle. These results were quite confusing at the beginning but 
latter on we realized that the procedure of measurement was not uniform. The follow-up values were obtained with a pacing 
polarity programmed to unipolar (bipolar sensing) compared with the values taken at implant, which were obtained at bipolar 
pacing, and also through the telemetry of different pacemakers from several manufacturers. </p>
<p>Sensing analysis was not one of the objectives of this study, but acute values were high enough and no atrial or ventricular 
sensing problems were detected within 6 month follow-ups. </p>
<p>One patient excluded from this study was paced with a DDD pacemaker implanted 5 years ago. He recieved a new 
ventricular Capsure Z lead after removing the old one. After one week, the pacing threshold was 1 V at 0.5 ms and after 2 
months it increased to 3.5 V. Impedance decreased from 1250 ohms to 870 ohms. A new Capsure Z lead was implanted 
without removing the previous one. The threshold of the new lead after 2 months was excellent (0.5 V at 0.1 ms) and the 
bipolar lead impedance was 1240 ohms. Could the process of removing the old lead influence such behavior? There were no 
cases of atrial or ventricular dislodgement in the study. </p>
<p>The use of the &#147;straight&#148; ventricular leads for atrial placement has been a standard practice in our unit since 1982. The 
incidence of dislodgement has been extremely low (0.6 % in more than 1800 atrial lead implants). </p>
<p><a name="DISCUSSION"><b>DISCUSSION</b></a> </p>
<p>There are a number of factors that can affect acute and chronic thresholds. It is well known that electrode size has an effect on 
threshold. Acutely, the smaller the electrode the lower threshold will be, according to equation 1, where E is the field strength 
required to depolarize the myocardium, V is the voltage and r is the electrode&#146;s radius. </p>
<p>V </p>
<p>1. E = - </p>
<p>r </p>
<p>Chronically, however, the foreign body response damages myocardium and increases the distance between the electrode and 
viable tissue, forming a &#147;virtual electrode&#148;. This affects threshold as modelled by Irnich in equation 2 <a href="#FOOTNOTE_4">[4]</a>. </p>
<p>V r </p>
<p>2. E = - {--------}2 </p>
<p>r r + d </p>
<p>where d is the thickness of the ideallized fibrotic capsule. Irnich concluded that the thickness of the virtual electrode is 
approximatelly a constant regardless of the (spherical) electrode&#146;s radius. Therefore, chronic thresholds decreases as the 
radius of the electrode decreases, until the radius of the electrode and the thickness of the fibrotic capsule are equal. At that 
point, chronic threshold is at its minimum. If the radius of the electrode is smaller than the thickness of the fibrotic capsule, then 
thresholds must increase rapidly. With polished electrodes, it was concluded by Irnich that about 5 mm<sup>2</sup> provide the optimum 
chronic electrode size for stimulation. Sensing on a 5 mm<sup>2 </sup>Elgioy ball tip, however, became a problem because some pulse 
generators of the time had a much too low input impedance to their amplifiers <a href="#FOOTNOTE_5">[5]</a> <a href="#FOOTNOTE_6">[6]</a>. Furman, et al concluded that about 8 
mm<sup>2</sup> provides the optimum compromise between minimum thresholds and good sensing <a href="#FOOTNOTE_7">[7]</a>. However, in more recent times, 
the rules were changed using porous and microporous electrode surface structures and steroid elution. Steroid elution has 
been known to control the foreign body reaction to the implanted electrode. This minimizes &#147;d&#148;, mitigating the acute to chronic 
threshold rise. In addition, microporosity in certain ranges also helps mitigate the foreign body response while also keeping 
polarization in acceptable ranges. This allows for the development of smaller electrodes without sacrificing thresholds or 
sensing. In addition, modern pulse generators amplifiers have very high input impedances to their amplifiers, making 
impedance mismatch a moot point. </p>
<p>Pacing impedance varies inversely with electrode size. Small electrodes, therefore, have high impedance, therefore, low 
current drain. If these electrodes are also microporous and steroid eluting, they can have low thresholds and excellent sensing. 
However, impedance can also be increased with higher conductor resistances. This is not recommended since more of the 
voltage is dropped across the conductors rather than across the electrode-tissue interfase, resulting in higher thresholds and 
wasted energy <a href="#FOOTNOTE_8">[8]</a>. </p>
<p>Our results clearly verifies the above theories, demonstrating that a high impedance lead with steroid elution at the tip offers 
very low acute and chronic thresholds. From our data, several conclusions may be drawn. During implantation, the probability 
of obtaining better threholds increases if the tip is placed in a position with the highest impedance. We feel that repositioning of 
the lead must be done when initial pacing impedance is lower than 1000 ohms. If, after several trials, impedance does not 
increase, the lead shoud be left in the position were the highest value was obtained. For example, we had several cases with 
pacing impedance on the low side for this lead (800-1100 ohms), but also with very low pacing thresholds (0.2-0.3 V at 0.5 
ms). Several attempts to find maximum impedance were also made in these cases. </p>
<p>The reason impedance may be an excellent and rapid indicator of optimum electrode-tissue interface contact may be 
explained on the basis of the respective anatomies. The electrode tip is placed between trabiculae in the ventricle and 
pectinate muscles in the atrium. As the lead is advanced for final placement, blood is squeezed out of the space if the electrode 
mates fully with the endocardium. If the tip is not fully advanced, then some blood remains. Since blood is more conductive 
than myocardium, the electrode that is fully advanced to endocardial contact will have higher impedance than one with a blood 
layer in-between. Small electrodes must be more sensitive to small changes in impedance. Therefore, impedance may be a 
sensitive indicator of electro-endocardial contact. It is then reasonable that the highest impedance will also produce the lowest 
thresholds, higher slew rates and amplitudes. We note that another indicator of electrode-tissue interface &#147;goodness&#148; is the 
injury potential, indicating that there is pressure on the endo/myocardial cells. This, however, is not as easy and fast to 
measure as impedance via the PSA. </p>
<p>Fixation of the lead body with an anchoring sleeve and fixation of the pulse generator to the pectoral muscle are important to 
minimize dislodgement or microdislodgement. In our practice, immobilization of the arm for several hours post-implant may 
also contribute to the excellent results we obtained. </p>
<p>There is a trend that suggests that bipolar impedance is higher than unipolar. Bipolar leads have higher conductor resistances 
since they have 2 conductors. Bipolar leads have a higher impedance anode, typically in the 30 to 50 mm<sup>2</sup> range, compared 
to the unipolar system&#146;s very large anode (pulse generator can) in the several hundreds of mm<sup>2</sup> size range. A counteracting 
factor tending to lower bipolar impedance is the relatively short inter-electrode tissue distance, resulting in a lower resistance. 
The sum total of these factors is the pacing impedance. The difference between unipolar and bipolar impedance systems is a 
matter of lead design, so there can be significantly differences between manufactures or models. None-the-less, bipolar 
systems usually have higher impedances than unipolar. In some cases, unipolar and bipolar impedance may be the same. 
Given the same cathode and conductor design, however, unipolar impedance can not be higher than bipolar. </p>
<p><a name="CONCLUSIONS"><b>CONCLUSIONS</b></a> </p>
<p>Our results permit us to conclude that Capsure Z is a very efficient lead in part because of its very high impedance, but also 
because of its unique cathode design. Thresholds are so low and stable that it could be possible to pace the atrium using a 
pulse duration of 0.5 ms at 1 V amplitude in 94 % of the p&agrave;tients. In the ventricle, 0.5 V and 0.5 ms is possible in 96 % of the 
patients. In both cases the generator&#146;s output is 5 times the threshold, providing excellent safety factors. The mean energy 
supplied chronically in the patients of this study was 2.3 to 1.1 microJ for the atrial lead and 1 to 0.4 microJ for the ventricular 
leads. In these circumpstances, the amount of energy (or current) used to pace the patient is extremelly small. This leaves most 
of the battery current capacity to allow for the implementation of more functions and diagnostic tools. This clearly shows that a 
new standard in pacing has evolved. <br>

	<font size=5>A</font>mericans like to think of their children as a source of pleasure rather 
than profit. Recently, when I asked people I know why they had had 
children, they talked about family values, about the kind of people they 
want to be, about the kind of world they want to leave behind. The one 
reason for having children that never came up was economic need.<P>
This is a curious thing, when you stop to think about it. Not so many 
generations ago people had children because they needed them. In those 
simpler, more agrarian days, a child was an extra set of hands to help 
support the family. And a child was insurance against being left 
unsupported and indigent in one's dotage. Earlier cultures didn't have the 
luxury of thinking of children as strictly a nonprofit venture. And the 
truth is, we don't either. Socializing many of the costs of old age let us 
think for a while that we had transcended the ancient economics of family. 
Now it seems that we were kidding ourselves.<P>
Children are very expensive--in terms of time, career, opportunities 
forgone, and cash. Thomas J. Espenshade, of Princeton University, has 
calculated that a middle-class family with two children is likely to spend 
about $100,000 to rear each child to age eighteen. And because people 
today are less likely to have children and the ones who do have children 
are having fewer of them, the American fertility rate is barely half what 
it was thirty years ago, when the Baby Boom was at its peak. Of the 
children that we do have, a higher proportion have been impoverished in 
this decade than at any other time since 1965: as of 1987 one in five 
American children lived in a poor family--this when the economy was 
strong. Forty-six percent of all black children lived in poverty in 1987; 
so did 40 percent of all Hispanic children. In New York City 38 percent of 
the children are poor. Why all this matters to the middle class may not be 
immediately obvious--which is just the problem. If boys and girls grew up 
to become industrial machinery instead of men and women, it would be easy 
to see that everybody had a stake in other peoples children.<P>
"Kids are a form of capital," David P. Hale. the chief economist of Kemper 
Financial Services, in Chicago, told me recently, when I asked him what 
was behind all the talk about "investing" in children "There was always an 
intellectual camp running around saying these things. But suddenly the 
intellectual camp has a following, out of need." As the sparse generation 
of the Baby Bust enters the work force, business is discovering that the 
supply of qualified young workers is tightening.<P>
This same sparse generation will have to undertake the potentially 
staggering burden, starting early in the next century, of paying the 
public costs of their parents' dependency. Inexorably, the 
intergenerational circle closes. Here is a question that every working-age 
American might do well to ask himself; If we have fewer kids, and if more 
of the ones we do have are slouching toward adulthood from poverty then 
how generously am I going to be supported in my old age?<P>
The past half century has established as a basic principle of American 
life that we will pay for other people's retirements. Today, as we face 
the need to nurture our work force and safeguard our retirements, the 
question forcing its way onto the agenda is how much more we will pay for 
other people's children. More out of necessity than out of choice, a new 
redistributional politics is emerging--a politics of redistribution from 
the childless to the child-rearing.<P>
It is no accident that George Bush, a pro-business, more or less 
conservative Republican, has proposed a European-style children's 
allowance. The proposal, a per-child federal subsidy for parents, would 
help only the poorest and is modest in scale--so modest that many liberals 
sneer at it, perhaps unwisely. A lot of the critics miss the point. 
Conceptually speaking, the Bush children's tax credit is a political 
preview of the next few decades.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>THE FUTURE NEEDS KIDS</b><P>
The national "family," having had fewer children, is going to find early 
in the next century that its labor force has stopped growing. New entrants 
into the work force are already becoming a scarce commodity, at least 
relative to what the country has been accustomed to. Projections are 
showing that in the 1990s the U.S. labor force will grow more slowly than 
it has at any time since the 1930s. Fully a third of the new entrants into 
the work force between now and the turn of the century will be members of 
minority groups. Those future minority workers are today's minority 
children--among whom the rates of poverty and illiteracy are highest. On 
average, poor children grow up to make poor workers. Poor workers generate 
lower standards of living for society--and for their old parents. The 
primordial interdependence of generations ultimately makes itself felt, 
albeit at the level of the national unit rather than the family unit.<P>
"The two ways that a society provides for its future," Frank Levy, an 
economist at the University of Maryland, told me, "are its level of 
physical capital accumulation"--that is, the number and quality of its 
machines, factories, roads, and so on--"and the number and the quality of 
its kids. In both cases, you can cheat on the accumulation and, by doing 
that, raise your current consumption. But eventually it comes back to 
haunt you."<P>
Right now about one in eight Americans is sixty-five or older. That will 
start changing fast, as the Baby Boom generation marches in unprecedented 
numbers across the line between work and retirement. According to 
projections by the Census Bureau, by late in the 2020s one in five 
Americans will be sixty-five or older. As the proportion of dependent 
elderly people in the adult population rises, the number of workers 
supporting each of them must fall. And that is exactly what is going to 
happen. The number of working-age people on hand to support each elderly 
person will drop by almost half, from almost five in 1990 to about two and 
a half by 2030 or so.<P>
This is a retirement burden whose like no generation of American workers 
has yet borne. John L. Palmer, of Syracuse University, has figured that 
the federal tax take will have to rise by an amount equivalent to at least 
five percent of the gross national product, and quite possibly a good bit 
more, to cover the health and pension costs of the Baby Roomers' 
retirement. Today the government takes in about 19 percent of the GNP in 
taxes. So we are talking about at least a 25 percent federal tax 
increase.<P>
Economically the burden is probably manageable. The important question is 
whether it is politically manageable. The country is already moving to 
raise the retirement age (thus increasing the worker-to-retiree ratio), 
and it's likely to have to reduce benefits to the elderly somewhat. But 
cutting benefits is politically inflammatory and, for those affected, 
personally wrenching. We can ease the need to take either step by making 
the workers we have more productive, getting more workers, or some 
combination of the two. For instance, we could save and invest more. That 
should boost the future productivity of the economy, making the retirement 
bill more affordable. Or we could import workers. Immigration, which 
brings new talent and muscle and youth to an aging population. is one of 
our richest resources--potentially a major advantage over Japan and the 
many European countries, like West Germany and France, that are aging even 
more rapidly than we are and that lack our immigrant tradition.<P>
Unfortunately, in a population as big as ours immigration can do only so 
much, and it is no substitute for seeing that the native labor force is 
adequately skilled. As for saving, the trouble is that we're saving less 
than we used to, not more, as our big budget deficits and low personal 
savings rates make clear. Besides, the better machines and equipment that 
we would presumably use our savings to invest in do not look after 
themselves; they tend to require better workers to run them. Inevitably, 
then, the discussion comes around to having more children or more
productive children or both--taking steps to replenish the child-capital 
stock, as it were.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>POLITICIANS NEED KIDS</b><P>
Many countries have long worried explicitly about the number and quality 
of their children; among the industrial countries, indeed, the United 
States is an oddity for its lack of an explicit or coherent family policy. 
Most of our allies and competitors run big redistribution programs to 
transfer money from people who don't have children to people who do. In 
some cases the rationale is out-and-out pronatalism: the idea is to get 
people to have more children, usually for cultural reasons even more than 
economic ones. France, in particular, has a long tradition of concern 
about the birth rate. Valery Giscard d'Estaing when he was the French 
President, once said, "A society no longer capable of assuring the 
replacement of generations is a condemned society." Many of the Western 
European programs that transfer money to families with children began as 
attempts to buy more children, although that goal has often faded away 
over time and been supplanted by social-welfare concerns.<P>
Eastern Europe, in contrast, remains explicitly pro-baby. Rumania doubled 
its fertility rate practically overnight after it took measures, in 1966, 
that sharply curtailed the availability of abortion, divorce, and 
contraception. (As it turned out, much of the effect was temporary.) 
Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia took the less 
intrusive, but very expensive, route of providing big economic inducements 
to parents--tax incentives, birth payments, preferential housing programs, 
paid maternity leave, and so on. According to one estimate, Hungary's 
inducement package paid more than a third of the costs of rearing 
children.<P>
Scholars who have examined incentive-based pronatalist programs generally 
conclude that over the long run they raise the birth rate very little, if 
at all--no doubt because government inducements of any practical size are 
overwhelmed by the total costs of rearing children and by considerations 
of life-style. (How much would the government have to pay you to have a 
child? Probably more than it could afford to.) "You get a short-run effect 
mainly in the timing of births," Thomas Espenshade, of Princeton, told me. 
"The lesson from Europe on these questions has been that governments have 
a difficult time buying babies, unless they're willing to spend several 
times more than they've been willing to spend to this point." Fertility 
rates in Eastern Europe are generally higher than those in noncommunist 
Europe, but whether that is owing to pronatalism or something else is a 
mystery.<P>
We Americans come from a different tradition. People here have always 
viewed the size of their families as a matter of personal rather than 
public concern. Yet even here some people are calling for outright 
pronatalism. One of them is Ben J. Wattenberg, of the American Enterprise 
Institute, a center right think tank in Washington, D.C. Citing Census 
Bureau projections that show the U.S. population ceasing to grow by the 
decade of the 2030s, Wattenberg thinks the government should offer big-
very big--per-child tax inducements to parents. "The only pronatalist 
policy that has any chance of working is serious dollars," he said. He is 
the first to admit that such a program might not get the birth rate up 
much. But even if it didn't, he pointed out, it would help solve the 
child-poverty problem. If you want to say what's the biggest problem in 
America, and you want to put it in two very short words, it's poor kids," 
Wattenberg said. "The question is, Can you make it easier for young 
couples who want to have children to be able to have children? You have 
half a century where the basic drive of this government--properly, in my 
judgment--was a redistribution of wealth from rich to poor. That isn't 
going to wash politically anymore. But suppose you say, instead of 
redistributing from rich to poor, 'Hey, I've got a pro-family program that 
redistributes money from the childless to the child-rearing.'" That kind 
of program could get liberals and conservatives on the same side, he said. 
"It's pro-family and it's pro-kids, and it's pro-poor-kids."<P>
He has a point. The way to get people to have more children is generally 
the same as the way to relieve poverty among children, which is generally 
the same as the way to help struggling young middle-class parents; 
transfer money to families with children. That fact helps account for the 
broad support in European countries for family-benefits programs. More 
than sixty countries, including most of the industrial ones, have what are 
known as family allowances or children's allowances, which typically pay 
families for each child an equivalent of five to ten percent of the 
average wage. The benefits may or may not be taxed, but they are generally 
universally available.<P>
Furthermore, well over a hundred countries, including Canada and countries 
throughout Europe, give one or both parents cash and time off from work 
when they have a new baby--typically about four months' paid leave. It's 
also common for countries to provide preschool or other child care for 
children three or older; France, Sweden, Italy, West Germany, Finland, 
Denmark, the Netherlands, Israel, and a number of Eastern European 
countries do that. All in all, America's transfer payments to children, 
measured as a percentage of the national output are less than half those 
of, for instance, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada.<P>
Generous family benefits have not created any sort of baby boom overseas. 
But they certainly help account for the fact that child-poverty rates are 
much lower abroad than here. I asked Sheila B. Kamerman, of the Columbia 
University School of Social Work, why public benefits for families with 
children are so generous in Europe and elsewhere. "The concept," she 
replied, "is that people with children are making a contribution to 
society, in terms of producing the future labor force and the quality of 
that labor force, the quality of citizens--even, if you will, financing 
the social
security system. Children are viewed as a social resource." This is less 
true in the United States. "The only way families with children have 
sustained their income in the last fifteen years has been with increased 
labor-force participation by mothers," Kamerman said. "Families have been 
putting more and more effort into rearing children, and it doesn't seem to 
be recognized. And the society is very dependent on those children, 
ultimately."<P>
In Europe the wide appeal of pro-family policies rests on a convergence of 
political interests. The right likes programs that support bigger 
families; the left likes programs that help prevent child poverty. "We may 
be moving in a similar direction," Kamerman observed. Political pressure 
is mounting to socialize more of the costs of raising kids--that is, to 
spread the burden of child-rearing.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>BUSINESS NEEDS KIDS</b><P>
In Washington you can hardly turn around these days without hearing about 
children's and family issues. Liberals are horrified at the high rate of 
poverty among children, and they understand that the best way to get money 
to needy families is to point out that these families have needy children. 
The right, too, is fighting for the pro-family banner. Social 
conservatives have been worrying for some time about economic and social 
pressures on the "traditional" family. They are pushing initiatives to 
come to families' aid. So, it seems, is almost everyone else. You can 
practically drown under the waves of press conferences and legislative 
proposals and speeches on children and families.<P>
The social activists have a new and important ally. "In the seventies," 
Frank Levy, of the University of Maryland, said, "corporations had workers 
coming out of their ears, so they didn't have to worry about the quality 
of the work force. They could just discard what they couldn't use. But 
once you have the labor force growing slowly and you start bumping into 
scarcity, then you have to assess the quality of the whole work force, 
because you can't just throw away the bottom quarter or twenty percent. 
Then you realize that we're all in this together."<P>
Today business is making contact with the sparse generation and finding it 
lacking. Alan Magazine, the president of the Council on Competitiveness, a 
Washington-based group whose leadership includes representatives of 
business, labor, and education, remarked in an interview with me, "We 
have, in a sense, a ticking time bomb that can't be ignored anymore. Some 
people have been saying that for years, but now people in the corporations 
are really seeing it. They're seeing it in the kinds of people they're 
hiring, the amount of money they have to spend for basic learning to get 
people up to a level that they can do even menial jobs; they're seeing it 
in the results of the tests that they give hundreds of people for 
minimum-wage jobs, and the numbers of people who actually pass those 
tests."<P>
The past few years have witnessed a redoubling of business's interest in 
issues relating to children and youth--above all, education, but also day 
care, child poverty, and so on. When I asked Walter B. Wriston, a former 
chairman of Citicorp, what accounted for this, he replied flatly, "The 
reason they're interested in it is, like anybody, self-interest. It isn't 
that people are more or less sensitive to education; it's that the 
realization grows that when a college freshman can't pick out the United 
States on a map of the world, we've got a problem."<P>
It is no coincidence that pro-business Republicans in Washington are 
starting to get interested in social issues--not just as "fairness" 
issues, which Republicans regard as belonging to Democrats, but as 
"productivity" issues, which Republicans view as their specialty. When 
business talks, Republicans listen. One morning in his office late last 
year, Senator Pete Domenici--a conservative, pro-business, 
balance-the-budget Republican who represents New Mexico--startled me by 
saying that it's time for the federal government to mount a campaign 
against what he called "socio
economic drags": the effects of undereducation, drugs, and poverty on the 
children of the inner cities. "I think these are very, very dangerous 
things for our economic productivity," he said. "They're not just social 
issues." We're only going to be hearing more of this kind of talk.<P>
<BR><p>
<b>COMMON GROUND?</b><P>
Businesses can attest to the fact that transferring resources to families 
with children doesn't necessarily involve government. Corporations are 
finding themselves providing more parental-support services to their 
workers. They have to. Employees with day-care problems lose productive 
hours, and so the number of companies in this country providing some sort 
of day-care help has risen dramatically in recent years. A mother who has 
a premature baby lands her company (if it provides health-care benefits) 
with big hospital bills, and so companies have started to provide maternal 
education programs. New parents need time off from work, and so a growing 
number of companies, especially large ones, provide paid parental leave. 
All these services are expensive. Consumers, stockholders, and childless 
employees pay.<P>
Many liberals like the idea of requiring businesses to assume more of the 
costs of children--for instance, they tend to favor legislation requiring 
companies to provide their workers with some form of maternity leave. 
Conservatives abhor that approach, although they usually aren't quick to 
suggest an alternative. That is not the only difference between the left 
and the right. Liberals, who seek to remove obstacles to women's entering 
the work force, want the government to provide day-care services for 
parents. Conservatives, many of whom would prefer that women care for 
their kids themselves, would rather just give parents money (which, in 
essence, is the strategy of Bush's proposed children's tax credit).<P>
Yet there is much common ground. I recently went to talk to Gary Bauer, 
the president of the Family Research Council of America, a conservative 
think tank on family policy and social values. Bauer was President 
Reagan's domestic-policy adviser for two years, and was known as one of 
the administration's hard-core social conservatives. When I arrived at his 
office, the first thing I picked up was a newsletter calling on the 
federal government to "offer assistance to first-time home buyers." "Home 
ownership," it complained, "is financially beyond the reach of many young 
families," and "such families should not have to choose between adopting a 
two career lifestyle or remaining perpetually propertyless." This is the 
kind of conservatism that liberal Democrats, who are the long-standing 
champions of government help for the middle class, ought to be able to cut 
a deal with.<P>
Bauer told me that an important strain of American conservatism has long 
focused on families, and on the stresses they encounter in trying to meet 
their responsibilities. "One of the things that astounded me when I was in 
the administration," he said, "was that from the end of World War Two to 
the present, the only group in society that really suffered a major 
increase in taxes, after adjusting for inflation and so on, was families 
with children"--which, he said, have taken an "incredible hit." In 
particular, the tax code's personal exemption is the main tax break for 
dependents. It allows you to subtract from your family's taxable income a 
certain amount per family member (now $2,000). In 1948 the exemption was 
high enough that a typical family with three or more children paid 
virtually no federal income taxes. Today the personal exemption has been 
so corroded by inflation that it would have to be more than tripled in 
order to shield from taxation as large a share of families' income as it 
did in 1948.<P>
Bauer's group, like many conservative organizations, favors greatly 
increasing the personal tax exemption, a step that, Bauer argues, would 
help all families with children, whether the woman chose to stay home or 
to work. I asked Bauer about per-child tax credits of the sort that many 
other countries have. "There's some support in the conservative community 
for the child-allowance approach," he said; but his group is still just 
considering it.<P>
Never underestimate the ability of liberals and conservatives to overcome 
their agreements and argue to a standstill. There are profound differences 
both within and between the left and the right over who should get relief 
from the high cost of kids (two-earner families or single-earner families 
or all families? everybody or just the poor?) and in what form relief 
should be provided (tax credits? tax exemptions? subsidized day care? 
mandated benefits for employees? cash?). "Both sides have philosophical 
approaches here that neither wants to concede," Bauer said. "I think there 
may be an inclination for gridlock for a while longer."<P>
<BR>
But something will give. Unrest in the middle class will see to that. 
Today almost two thirds of women with children--and well over half of 
married women with children under six--are in the work force, whether out 
of choice or out of necessity (the comparable figures in 1960 were 30 
percent and less than 70 percent, respectively). Many of these women and 
their husbands are financially strained, and they want help with the costs 
of their kids, and they vote. That, finally, is why President Bush found 
himself proposing a children's allowance.<P>
Well, who could be against doing more for families with children anyway? 
The answer is that people who do not have children could be against it, 
because they would pay the bill. And it is a big bill. According to the 
Census Bureau, 30 percent of American families with children were getting 
by on incomes of less than $20,000 in 1987. To give significant aid to 
significant numbers of those families runs into a lot of money fast. For 
instance suppose we raised the personal exemption to $6,300, so that it 
would shield as much of families' income as it did in 1948. Each child 
would then reduce a median-income family's taxes by about $950 a year as 
against about $300 today. An extra $650 per child per year wouldn't solve 
parents' every problem, but it would certainly help. The trouble is that a 
tax cut of that size would cost the Treasury enough to almost double the 
federal deficit. Making exceptions or targeting the poor would reduce the 
cost. But it would also weaken middle-class support, because it would 
change the issue from making children cheaper for everybody to making 
children cheaper for the poor--a very different kettle of fish, 
politically speaking. The unhappy fact is that any program, public or 
private, that brings substantial relief to middle-class parents is going 
to be very expensive.<P>
When we discuss spreading through society more of the burdens of child
rearing, we are talking about transferring money from the later part of 
adulthood to the earlier, and also from those who do not have children to 
those who do. People with families would get government subsidies during 
their child-rearing years; then, as they passed into middle age and 
beyond, they would pay higher taxes to support the younger group coming 
behind. People without children would simply pay higher taxes throughout 
life. That is the essence of the new redistributional politics: the 
middle-aged, the elderly, and the childless would inevitably have to 
sacrifice more so that young parents would not have to sacrifice so 
much.<P>
Within families, this sort of spreading of sacrifice between old and 
young, between those who have kids to support and those who don't, goes on 
all the time. The problem coming before us today is how to do something 
similar in society as a whole without tearing ourselves apart 
politically.

	<font size=5>I</font>t was "noble, revolutionary--and probably the most thoughtless of the many

acts of the Great Society." Thus did Theodore White, chronicler of all that is

brave and optimistic about America, assess in 1982 the thing his country had

done to itself seventeen years earlier. He was not talking about the decision

to increase the commitment of American ground forces to South Vietnam, nor

about the beginning of programs that would end in racial quotas and

school-busing orders, nor about the inauguration of Medicare and other benefits

whose costs the public would in the 1980s be struggling to pay. Rather, this

most thoughtless gesture was the Immigration and Nationality Act amendments of

1965.<p>



<p>



<p>



The new laws were not expected to increase the flow of immigrants to this

country. Indeed, for the first time in America's history, they put limits on

the numbers that could enter from Mexico, the Caribbean, and elsewhere in the

Western Hemisphere. But the laws did revolutionize the nature of the immigrant

population. Back in the 1920s, when the U.S. first placed limits on the number

of immigrants it would accept, the central principle of immigration policy was

that America's new citizens should resemble its old ones. Under the

"national-origins" system introduced in 1921, quotas for European immigration

preserved the "racial preponderances" within the American population. Ireland,

for example, could send each year 3 percent as many immigrants as there were

foreign-born Irish-Americans counted in the U.S. Census of 1910. (In 1924, the

quotas were made more restrictive. They were set at 2 percent of the ethnic

representation among Americans, foreign-born and native-born, shown in the 1890

Census. ) The national-origins system was designed as a shield against the "New

Immigration" of Poles, Italians, Slavs, and Eastern European Jews.<p>



<p>



<p>



With the Immigration Act amendments of 1965, the United States announced that

it would look impartially on the world. The Ethiopian, the Turk, the resident

of Calcutta or Rangoon, would compete on equal footing with the Englishman and

the German. America would open itself not merely to the tired and the poor but

to the racial and ethnic balance of the wide world. The result, wrote Theodore

White, was "a stampede, almost an invasion." The "sources of fresh arrivals

[would be] determined not by those already here, but by the push and pressures

of those everywhere who hungered to enter."<p>



<p>



<p>



Those pressures are sobering to contemplate. According to the International

Labour Organization, the total labor force of the Third World countries will be

600 million to 700 million people larger in the year 2000 than it was in 1980.

To employ all those additional workers, the developing countries would have to

create more jobs than now exist in Western Europe, Japan, the United States,

the Soviet Union, and the other industrialized nations combined. Obviously,

that will not happen, and some of those who cannot find work, especially in

Latin America, will decide to leave.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Especially" Latin America because the riches of the United States lie within

easy reach of so much of Central and South America, and because population

growth there is exceptionally fast. The combined population of the Latin

American nations was about 150 million in the early 1950s. It is expected to be

845 million by 2025. Half of the people in Latin America are eighteen years old

or under; they will be entering the labor force, looking for work in their

countries or ours, in the next generation. Robert Fox, of the Inter-American

Development Bank, points out that the total Latin American labor force is now

about 115 million, but will be 197 million twenty years from now. "This is

intractable," he has said. It is based on a population already born. Latin

American countries would have to create an average of 4 million new jobs each

year until 2025 [to accommodate the growth]. The U.S., with an economy five

times larger, averages 2 million new jobs per year."<p>



<p>



<p>



Regardless of these projections, the flow of immigrants from the Third World

has already begun. From 1930 to 1960 about 80 percent of America's immigrants

came from European countries or Canada. From 1977 to 1979, 16 percent did, and

Asia and Latin America accounted for about 40 percent each. In 1979, the nine

leading "source" countries for legal immigration were Mexico, the Philippines,

Korea, China and Taiwan, Vietnam, India, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and

Cuba. In tenth place, with 3 percent of the total, was the United Kingdom.<p>



<p>



<p>



The structure of the immigration code meant that the Third World's share of new

Americans was likely to increase. Under the post-1960 law, places in the

immigration queue are assigned with grand indifference to ethnic origin but

with careful attention to family ties. The immediate relatives of American

citizens--parents, minor children, and spouses--are admitted without limit. In

recent years, some l00,000 people have entered this way annually. In addition,

the law provides for 270,000 immigrants each year (no more than 20,000 from any

one country) in the "numerically limited" categories, which heavily favor less

immediate relatives. Eighty percent of the 270,000 places are allotted to the

adult children or the brothers and sisters of U.S. citizens, plus the immediate

relatives of non-citizens who are here as permanent resident aliens. The

remaining places go to those with skills considered valuable to the American

economy, or to those who would simply like to come. The law's premium on family

connections means that each new arrival from the Philippines or Korea

eventually makes many others in those countries eligible for admission.<p>



<p>



<p>



Beyond this change in the mix, there has been a change in numbers. In 1980, at

least 125,000 Cubans and Haitians arrived in southern Florida and were admitted

as "special entrants," a category invented to cope with the influx. Since 1975,

the U.S. has accepted over half a million refugees from Indochina. More than

160,000 came in 1980 alone, which together with the Cubans and Haitians pushed

that year's total for legal admissions to 808,000, the highest in sixty years.

<p>



<p>



<p>



And this is to speak only of lawful entrants. As Latin America's population has

grown and its governments and economies have foundered, more and more of its

people have looked northward for relief. In the mid-1970s, the commissioner of

the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Leonard Chapman, said that there

might be as many as 12 million foreigners here illegally. Official estimates

are now 50 to 75 percent lower than that, but no one can say with confidence

how many illegal aliens are here and how many more are coming. In many of the

big cities of the north, throughout the southwestern states, and in the

labor-intensive farming regions of the east and west coasts, daily life

provides signs of the illegal tide. Early this year, the attorney general of

the United States, William French Smith, proclaimed, "Simply put, we've lost

control of our own borders."<p>



<p>



<p>



As the immigrants continue to arrive, the alarm bells have begun to ring. From

liberals and conservatives alike have come warnings about the implications of

the trend. Clare Booth Luce, the venerable Republican, has said that the

immigrants will be more difficult to absorb because they are not white. Carl

Rowan, a black Democrat, has written about the "immigration nightmare." Ray

Marshall, secretary of labor in the Carter Administration, has claimed that we

could worry much less about unemployment if we got rid of illegal immigrants.

Jesse Helms and Paula Hawkins, two of the most conservative members of the U.S.

Senate, have argued that if the U.S. doesn't help defeat the guerrillas in El

Salvador, we will be flooded with Salvadoran refugees, as we were with refugees

from Vietnam. Labor leaders have issued statements saying that immigrant

workers are stealing Americans' jobs.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Our immigration policy is making us poorer, not richer" Richard Lamm, the

Democratic governor of Colorado, said this year. "It is dividing our wealth and

resources." Last year, Lamm contended that America's economic "pie" had stopped

growing and that "the unchanging pie dramatically alters an issue like

immigration, for now additional people will have to take from that pie rather

than contribute to it. . . . Who needs additional people when we cannot employ

our own citizens?"



After many months of travel through the parts of the United States most

affected by immigration, it is clear to me that something big is going on. To

see Koreans, Vietnamese, and Cambodians contending for places with the

Mexicans, Salvadorans, blacks, and "Anglos" of Los Angeles is to glimpse what

New York must have been like when Ellis Island was more than a monument. To

examine Miami's recent economic, political, and social history is to see Cuban

and Haitian immigration as the event around which all others turn. In countless

other places, from Brooklyn to rural Wisconsin, from Houston to Orange, New

Jersey, the words heard in the air, the clothes and faces seen on the street,

the courses taught in the schools, have all changed because of immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



But it is far from clear to me that the changes under way are ominous or bad.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The best-known "facts" about today's immigration are, in many cases, not facts

at all. Because of the 808,000 people who were admitted legally in 1980,

politicians and authorities have suggested that the U.S. is experiencing an

unprecedented foreign flow. A well-respected immigration expert, Michael

Teitelbaum, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, has written in

*Foreign Affairs* that "immigration and refugee flows to the United States in

the late 1970s were at or near the highest levels ever experienced...."<p>



<p>



<p>



This is hyperbole. The year 1980 was the recent peak. One year later, after the

Cuban and Haitian boatlift was over, and after the greatest surge of

Indochinese refugees had passed, legal immigration fell to 697,000. By

contrast, it was 1.2 million in 1907, and exceeded one million in five other

years near the turn of the century. Today's figures do not include illegal

immigrants, but the figures from the turn of the century (when there were few

illegals) do not include anyone who arrived legally by ship in cabin class or

by land, from Canada or Mexico.<p>



<p>



<p>



Since the American population was so much smaller early in the century, the

relative impact of immigration was far greater then. From 1880 to 1890, and

again from 1900 to 1910, the average annual flow of counted immigrants was

equal to more than one percent of the American population. From 1970 to 1979,

it was *one-fifth* of one percent. The foreign-born made up 4.7 percent of the

population in 1970; they made up 8.8 percent in 1940 and 14.8 percent in

1910.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many politicians and experts assert that the U.S. is unique in its

vulnerability to immigration. Governor Lamm, for example, says that "the

unemployed...will never get jobs as long as we continue to take in twice as

many immigrants as the rest of the world combined." The "twice as many"

calculation simply fails to count nearly one million Ethiopian refugees who

have fled to Somalia (a nation of 4 million people) and the 1.5 million Afghans

displaced into Pakistan. In normal years, the U.S. does admit more immigrants

and refugees than any other country, but Canada and Australia have accepted

more relative to their population sizes. From 1956 to 1978, the U.S. never

received more than 2.8 legal immigrants for each thousand in its population.

During the same period, Canada's rate was as high as 17 per thousand, and

Australia's rate was as high as 15.1.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet statistics are at best a crude indication of people's real concerns about

immigration, and a statistical rebuttal is not enough. "It is difficult to

explain to residents of the community that the Indochinese refugees are drying

skinned cats out on the clothes line because they enjoy cats as a delicacy in

their country," the mayor of Santa Ana, California, told a congressional

committee in 1981. It is difficult to feel at ease about the impact of the new

arrivals, difficult to guess whether the cultural fabric will stretch, as it

has before, or finally be torn.<p>



<p>



<p>



The unspoken question about the immigrants is *What are they doing to us?* Will

they divide and diminish the nation's riches? Will they accept its language?

Will they alter racial relations? Will they respect the thousand informal rules

that allow this nation of many races to cohere?<p>



<p>



<p>



MONEY<p>



<p>



Economists who study the effects of immigration take two very different

approaches. One school views immigrants primarily as additional people--new

workers in the labor force, extra purchasers in the national market. From this

perspective, immigration can sometimes be valuable, if the labor it provides

alleviates a shortage. Thus Western Europe needed immigrant "guest workers" to

ease its labor shortage in the 1960s. And thus, contends the economist Julian

Simon, immigrants can help the United States. The value of immigrants Simon

says, is that they "represent additional *people* as people...[and] lead to

faster economic growth by increasing the size of the market, and hence boosting

productivity and investment." In addition, since so many of the immigrants are

young, they can help offset the aging of the American work force. Most of those

who see immigration from the labor-market perspective conclude, unlike Simon,

that immigrants hurt a mature economy like that of the United States. If the

immigrants are uneducated and unskilled--farmers, peasant craftsmen--they will

drag down the overall productivity rate. They will, in effect, more narrowly

divide the economic pie.<p>



<p>



The other economic approach pays little attention to how many immigrants

arrive. It concentrates instead on the economic behavior of those who survive

the process of migration. This view is propounded by economists who place great

stress on "human capital," the mixture of talents and cultural incentives that

makes Germany economically different from England and Hong Kong from Macao.

From this perspective, the ingenuity and perseverance that immigrants possess

can make an economy richer, because immigrants will adapt and innovate and

sacrifice in ways that non-immigrants are too comfortable to try. They make the

pie larger for everyone to share.<p>



<p>



<p>



I came to find the second approach more realistic, for reasons I can best

present through the story of the Nguyen family, formerly of Saigon, now of Los

Angeles.<p>



<p>



<p>



In 1975, the four brothers and six sisters of the immediate Nguyen family lived

in Saigon with their parents plus the extended family of nephews and

brothers-in-law. The father ran a small import-export business. The children

held clerical or professional jobs. Two were in the Army of the Republic of

Vietnam (ARVN); one of them had been a law student before he was drafted. One

son was an architectural draftsman, and one was a lawyer. Two daughters worked

as secretaries, one in a South Vietnamese government ministry, the other at the

U.S. Embassy. Although the family was not part of Saigon's moneyed elite, it

was respectably successful. Because of the daughter who worked for the

Americans, the family was on a list of people the U.S. planned to evacuate if

Saigon fell.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the chaos that engulfed Saigon in April of 1975, the onetime law student,

Mr. Nguyen, was the first of the family out of Saigon. (He has asked that his

given name not be used) How did he escape? "In panic," he says. He made his way

to Tan Son Nhut airport, where the rescue helicopters were supposed to land. He

was thirty years old and spoke no English.<p>





Mr. Nguyen was taken to Clark Air Base in the Philippines, then to Guam, and

eventually to a resettlement base at Camp Pendleton, California. There he spent

the next six months. In camp, he volunteered to work for the U.S. Catholic

Conference, which was (and remains) heavily involved in resettling refugees. In

time he came to be paid $5 a day for helping to coordinate the many details in

finding homes for the refugees. When the camp closed, at the end of October,

1975, he was the last refugee released.<p>



<p>



<p>



Across the vast expanse of the Los Angeles basin Mr. Nguyen traveled in search

of work. His first break came in November. In El Segundo he found work as an

assembler in a waterbed factory, for $2.10 an hour, then the minimum wage.

After Mr. Nguyen had accepted the job, the foreman asked him for his address.

"I told him I didn't know, because I didn't live any place yet. I was only

going to rent a place after I got a job."<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Nguyen had his first foothold, but not much more than that. He was taking

home less than $400 per month, and was paying $120 for his room. On leaving the

camp, Mr. Nguyen had been entitled to $300 for resettlement expenses, but he

had refused the money. "I had pride. I wanted to feel that I had made it

without any help," he says. "But I felt lonely and miserable. In those

factories, you can't slow down." He was buoyed only by his glimpses of other

Vietnamese adjusting to industrial life. "You see one person in the corner, he

might have been a farmer in Vietnam. He survived, I can survive."<p>



<p>



<p>



Three weeks later, he heard of another possibility, an opening with RCA. On his

time off, he went to the RCA record factory and said that he'd had experience

with studios and music back in Vietnam. The personnel man listened with feigned

attentiveness and told him that he sounded like the man for the job. When Mr.

Nguyen reported for work, he found that he would be putting labels on records

for $3 an hour.<p>



<p>



<p>



"I learned that money is really valuable in this country," he says. "You pay

for it with blood and tears. I started thinking about that $300. Money is

money. Why not collect it and put it in the bank and earn interest instead of

just ignoring it?"<p>



<p>



<p>



Having steeled himself to claim his resettlement bonus, Mr. Nguyen went into a

religious-charities office to apply. While there he ran into the resettlement

director, who knew of his work in the camp. The charities were looking for a

man like him, she said. Mr. Nguyen started to tell her he couldn't speak

English well enough, but she shushed him with the reassurance that he'd be put

in a training program. The pay would be $660 a month. He accepted. By the end

of 1975, Mr. Nguyen was a white-collar worker.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Meanwhile, the rest of the family has adapting to life in the newly christened

Ho Chi Minh City. Nguyen Ninh, the brother who had been a draftsman, escaped

purges directed at other technicians because, as he remembers now, "they needed

our skills to make the machinery run." Yet he suspected that sooner or later

his usefulness would end. One of his brothers named Viet, had been a lieutenant

in the South Vietnamese Army and was being held in a "re-education camp." When

Viet escaped from the camp, after two years' detention, he joined Ninh in a

plan to flee the country.<p>



<p>



<p>



With friends, the brothers bought an old boat from country people and then

covertly brought it to the city to fortify it for an ocean voyage. None of them

had been on the water, but they tried to teach themselves seamanship. One night

in 1977, they set out, seven people in a boat that Nguyen Ninh says was not

more than twelve feet long.<p>



<p>



<p>



They hoped to reach Malaysia, but the winds blew hard from that quarter. On the

eighth day at sea, the boat's engine failed, and they drifted where the wind

pushed them.<p>



<p>



<p>



"After the broken engine, we figure 99 percent that we die in the ocean," Ninh

said this spring. "Nearly everyone who goes in a boat dies." Commercial ships

passed, but they kept on going, some even adjusting their course so as to avoid

entanglement with the troublesome boat people. The boat began to leak, and then

it sank. The men were in the water, swimming, reckoning their remaining time in

hours.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the distance, a large, dark shape loomed. It was a freighter from Kuwait.

Its captain, looking through his binoculars, was startled by the sight of men

swimming in the ocean. When rescued, they were 200 miles from Vietnam.<p>



<p>



<p>



They had avoided death, but for the next year the two Nguyen brothers lived as

stateless men. Immigration officials would not let them go ashore at the ship's

next stop, Singapore. They lived aboard ship till it returned to Kuwait, and

when it got there they were jailed. Its next voyage was to Vietnam, they were

told, and it would take them back home. The brothers tried to reach embassies,

the Red Cross, the UN, but they got nowhere until a sailor agreed to mail a

letter to Mr. Nguyen in California.<p>



<p>



<p>



With efforts under way in Los Angeles and Kuwait, the men were classified as

refugees and, after three months in jail, were turned over to the UN. They

spent eight more months in a UN refugee camp in Greece, where they worked as

farm laborers. After Mr. Nguyen was certified as their sponsor in the U.S.,

they were accepted as refugees. On June 22, 1978, they arrived in America.<p>



<p>



<p>



Like their brother, they spoke no English on arrival, but they began learning

as they looked for work. Beyond supporting themselves, they hoped to send money

to the family members still in Vietnam, to help them buy their way out. Viet,

the former ARVN lieutenant, got a job at a valet-parking outfit at the Los

Angeles International Airport, for the minimum wage. Ninh became a carpenter's

helper. A few months later, he found a place as a trainee draftsman with a

machine-tool company.<p>



<p>



<p>



Four sisters and a nephew were the next Nguyens to come over. They went by boat

to a refugee camp in Indonesia. In 1979, they joined their brothers in Los

Angeles.<p>

<p>



<p>



Then the other two sisters escaped. One, Hai, had been a student; the other,

Mai, had worked at the U.S. Embassy. In 1980 they set out on foot. With two

children, they traveled west to Cambodia and then walked for seven days through

the jungles of Cambodia to the Thai border. In Thailand, they were admitted to

a refugee camp. There they stayed for six months. In 1980, with Mr. Nguyen

acting as their sponsor, they entered the United States. They were among the

808,000 admissions that alarmed many Americans that year.<p>



<p>



<p>



The family with which they were reunited had changed dramatically in the

previous five years. Mr. Nguyen had become a citizen and was married to another

Vietnamese immigrant. He and the other brothers were established in a way that

would have been hard to imagine when they first arrived, as dispossessed

persons. They had assimilated so fully as to see that in Southern California in

the late seventies, the road to financial independence was real estate. After

Ninh and Viet arrived, in 1978, the three brothers had pooled their money in

hopes of buying a house. Each of them was eventually bringing home about $1,000

a month; by sharing living expenses, they saved about $2,000 a month. By 1979,

they had accumulated enough for a down payment on a house in Downey, a

respectable middle-class suburb. All three signed the mortgage.<p>



<p>



<p>



Viet had saved enough money from his work at the parking lot to buy a small

furniture store, too. As he was contemplating the investment, he told Mr.

Nguyen that it would consume all his savings. Mr. Nguyen replied that if he

lost the money, he could always earn it back, but if the gamble paid off, he'd

be independent. Ninh was by then earning $10 an hour as a professional

draftsman.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Nguyen, the Benjamin Franklin of the family, encouraged his sisters to

train for better jobs. Hai took a course in accounting and wound up working for

a Vietnamese dentist in Long Beach. Mai studied cosmetology. She did not like

it, but her brother pushed her to see it through. She finished, and found a job

in West Los Angeles. She made the sixty-mile commute daily, and by the end of

1980 she was earning $2,000 a month doing nails. By 1982, she had a chance to

buy her own salon. The family pooled its assets and took out loans, and now she

runs Mai's Beauty Salon, in Beverly Hills, hard by Rodeo Drive. The family's

father finally arrived, having first escaped to Belgium and established himself

as a baker.<p>



<p>



<p>



All the while, Mr. Nguyen was improving his own position. He rented the house

in Downey to other members of his family, eight siblings and in-laws. They pay

$100 a month apiece, which covers the mortgage. Mr. Nguyen has moved with his

wife to a second house. They have carefully worked out their financial

timetable. In a few years, they will have retired the second mortgage on their

home, and his wife can quit her job as a chief bank teller to have children.<p>



<p>



<p>



When I went to visit the house in Downey, home to nearly a dozen people,

counting the children, I was prepared for a sense of confinement, or of brave

endurance amid squalor, or of practically anything except the serene order I

found. It sits amid other unexceptional, modern California houses, with a vista

of a distant freeway, on a street like a thousand others in the Los Angeles

basin. Inside the house, the sisters and brothers, arriving late after long

commutes from their farflung businesses, changed quickly into Vietnamese

pajamas and kimonos and took their leisure in the living room. Delicately

colored prints of Asian scenes hung on the walls. The dining table stood on a

platform with a canopy overhead, giving the effect of an indoor gazebo. The

only external indication of the struggle for advancement going on within was

the seven cars that jammed the driveway and lined the curb.<p>



<p>



<p>



The adults, thin and short, spoke in heavily accented English about their

arrivals, which in some cases were only a year in the past. Two elementary

school children, whose father was still in jail in Vietnam, appeared in

American-style pajamas and shyly answered questions in American tones. The

family is still saving money, in preparation for the mother and for the spouses

and siblings yet to arrive.<p>



<p>



<p>



Mr. Nguyen's job involves assisting many new arrivals from Indochina. He tells

them that they must adjust to the "new life" in the United States, as his

family has done. He warns them against welfare, although he says he cannot

blame people for accepting the $600 a month, plus food stamps and medical

benefits, that welfare provides. "I tell them, If you go on job training, you

will learn the English faster. Welfare will make you lazy. You will hesitate to

work and hesitate to speak English."<p>



<p>



The Nguyen family is, of course, not typical of all immigrants. Its members,

with their education and their white-collar backgrounds, started out several

steps ahead of the peasants and farmers who fled at the same time. The refugee

camps, however cheerless, and the resettlement bonuses, however small, were

more help than many other immigrants receive. Most important, the Nguyens'

status as legal, fully entitled participants in American society made it easier

for them to establish credit, buy homes, start businesses, and move up the

ladder rung by rung.<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, there *is* something in their story that is typical of immigrants'

histories. However hard it was to continue living in Ho Chi Minh City (or, in

earlier eras, Pinsk or Palermo), it took a certain daring to set out in the

boat or walk through the jungle. At worst, the emigrants would die or be

captured. At best, they would arrive as uprooted foreigners, ignorant of the

language and the mores that compose their new culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some theorists speculate that the act of emigration is a kind of natural

selection: those who are passive or fatalistic--or comfortable--do not take the

step. Others suggest that the rigors of the passage teach the immigrants the

skills they need to survive. In any case, there is little dispute that an

"immigrant personality" exists, and that its elements are the same ones that,

in retrospect, are so apparent in the nation's previous immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



Compared with people who have not been forced to land on their feet, immigrants

are generally more resourceful and determined. (A twenty-three-year-old man

from El Salvador, who had come to the U.S. illegally and was working in

Houston, told me that he could not understand all the talk about unemployment.

Why, he himself was holding three jobs.) The full story of the immigrant

personality would also include the psychological burdens of dislocation. But

looked at from the economic point of view, the immigrant's grit and courage,

and even his anxieties, impart productive energy to the society he joins.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is different from saying that immigrants are valuable primarily for their

specific talents. Some are, of course; the harvest ranges from Albert Einstein

to Rod Carew. But through American history, the great masses of immigrants have

not brought with them special skills. Most have come from the lower, but not

the bottom, ranks of their native societies. They are people without advantages

of birth who are nonetheless on the way up.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Those who do come to the United States are those who are advancing within

their own societies," says Ray Marshall, now of the University of Texas; "those

who have attained the necessary knowledge of America and how to get here, and

who have accumulated or been able to borrow the funds they need to pay for

their airline tickets or to pay their smugglers."<p>



<p>



<p>



The single most important quality in immigrants is the willingness to adapt.

The very traits that persuade someone to move from Guatemala to Los Angeles, or

even from Detroit to Houston, often enable the immigrant to find and fill

economic gaps, which is what the Nguyen family did, and what many other

immigrants have done.<p>



<p>



<p>



Not every immigrant becomes an entrepreneur; a man who pushed a hand plow in a

Mexican village will probably pick vegetables or wash dishes if he comes to the

United States. The more temporary the visit, the more likely the immigrant is

merely to sell his unskilled labor, rather than look for a special niche.

Economists distinguish such "sojourner" behavior from the attitude of the true

immigrant. It typified many Italian sojourners in the United States eighty

years ago and French-Canadians in New England until several decades ago, and

probably typifies most illegal immigrants from Mexico in recent years.<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, there is evidence beyond the anecdotal about the economic benefits

immigration can bring to the new homeland. The Urban Institute, which has been

conducting a study of the California economy in the 1970s, recently released

its preliminary findings:<p>



<p>



<p>



During the 1970s, when Southern California received more immigrants than any

other part of the country, it also created jobs faster than any other, and its

per capita income increased by 25 percent, also higher than the norm.

Immigration was far from the only factor in these increases, the study

reported; but, it said, the findings suggest, "at least at the aggregate level,

that large-scale immigration did not depress, and perhaps increased, per capita

income in the state"--that is, it did not divide the pie. On balance, the study

said, the economic benefits to the region--results of the new human energy, the

entrepreneurship, the adaptability-- outweighed the costs, which primarily came

from the immigrants' use of public services, such as hospitals and schools.<p>

Although immigration is a divisive issue in Miami, almost no one disputes the

economic bonus the Cuban community now represents. The first to flee Castro

were mainly professionals and businessmen, who soon repeated their success

here. The second and third waves were less select, more like America's other

immigrants; the first-wave Cubans grumbled that those who had lived under

communism had lost their drive. Still, they were absorbed into Little Havana,

where they opened shops and restaurants and kept the town alive. Miami's Cuban

population has helped make it the entrepot for Latin American trade, to the

occasional sorrow of the Drug Enforcement Administration, but to the

satisfaction of financiers.<p>



<p>



<p>



Immigrants eagerly join the American race to get ahead. According to Barry

Chiswick, of the University of Illinois, the sons and daughters of immigrants

earn 5 to 10 percent more than others of the same age and educational level

whose parents were native-born. The immigrants themselves, compared with

native-born people of the same race and with the same amount of schooling,

start out at a big earnings disadvantage. But, in a matter of years, even the

first generation catches up with and then passes the native-born. This

"earnings crossover" occurs after fifteen years for Mexican immigrants and

after eleven for black immigrants. According to Thomas Sowell, a conservative

black scholar, second-generation black-skinned West Indians in the United

States have a higher average income than native-born white Americans.<p><p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Those opposed to immigration respond to these tales of success with three

objections.<p>



<p>



<p>



The first is demographic. One by one, immigrants may add to the national

wealth, but collectively they frustrate efforts to limit America's population.

Arguments about the ultimate "carrying capacity" of America's farmland, water

supply, and other natural resources have been muted in the past decade, as

American fertility rates have fallen. But many who are concerned about

population growth naturally believe that each new immigrant puts ecological

equilibrium that much further out of reach.<p>



<p>



<p>



Those who advance this case often claim that immigration now accounts for half

the total increase in the U.S. population. That is almost certainly not true.

During the 1970s, the American population grew by less than one percent a year.

The roughly 4 million legal immigrants admitted during that decade accounted

for 21 percent of the growth. In comparison, the population grew by 2 percent

per year from 1900 to 1910, and immigrants accounted for 40 percent of the

increase.<p>



<p>



<p>



If legal and illegal immigration combined did, as many environmentalists

assert, account for half the increase in the 1970s, then there must have been

more illegal than legal immigrants during that period. No one familiar with the

subject believes that so many came. Lawrence Fuchs is a professor at Brandeis

University who was executive director of the staff of the Select Commission on

Immigration and Refugee Policy, the government body that in 1981 recommended

changes in immigration law. The Census Bureau has estimated, he says, that in

1978 between 3.5 million and 6 million illegal immigrants were present in the

U.S. Fuchs says, "Since we know that some of those have been coming since long

before 1970, and since we also know that a large proportion of them are persons

who go back and forth and are definitely not permanent residents, it is clearly

fallacious to assert a number such as 50 percent without carefully qualifying

it."<p>



<p>



<p>



The demographic argument cannot be dismissed. But if immigrants bring

adaptability to an economy, they may thereby increase the chances of finding

new ways to use and conserve resources. Environmental concern means that we

must strike a balance between two competing virtues: a sustainable population.

and the invigorating effects of immigration. Too many of the environmental

activists sound as if immigration is an unrelieved evil.<p>



<p>



<p>



The second objection concerns international equity, even morality. It starts

with the premise that immigration is a naturally selective process. Precisely

because immigrants are so industrious, it is argued, the United States should

not be skimming them from the poor nations of the world. Roger Conner, the

executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR),

told a congressional committee in 1981 that the 808,000 legal immigrants and

refugees admitted the previous year represented one five-thousandth of the

population of the world. "Out of 5,000 impoverished people, we took one, taking

the brightest, most able, most energetic, the best organized," he said. "We are

taking the cream of each social class by the standards of their society...."We

are taking the most energetic and talented."<p>



<p>



<p>



In a human family of great riches and greater deprivation, a country as

comfortable as the United States has an obligation to help. But of the varied

ways in which America might advance the interests of poor countries, closing

the door on their people seems one of the least effective, direct, or fair.<p>



<p>



<p>



"We never heard this argument from experts in economic development or from the

developing countries themselves," says Lawrence Fuchs. "We only heard it from

Americans who oppose immigration."<p>



<p>



<p>



Third, many people object to immigration because of the Americans it hurts.

Overall, the nation might gain from immigration, they concede. But the benefits

go to the most comfortable Americans, and the costs are absorbed by the least

powerful and privileged.<p>



<p>



<p>



Roger Conner is one of the foremost apostles of this view.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner is a compact, sandy-haired lawyer, thirty-five years old, with a

puckishly all-American look. Like many other lobbyists in Washington, he seems

to be struggling to resist grabbing his listeners by the lapels so as to be

sure they'll hear all he has to say. In the past, he channeled his enthusiasm

into the environmental movement, but, he says, he came to feel that immigration

was the biggest environmental question of all. For the past four years, as

executive director of and chief spokesman for FAIR, he has been asking

Americans to re-examine their assumptions about immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner is exasperated by the notion that you can understand the effects of

immigration by looking at the immigrants. "They are the last people you'd want

to talk with," he said this spring. "Of course it's been good for them.

Especially for the first ten years, they will work very hard. But what no one

ever does, when they're out talking with the aliens and hearing their success

stories, is talk to the people who are paying the price."<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner admits that most people may profit from immigration. The immigrants

themselves do, and so do those Americans who don't compete with immigrant labor

and therefore are free to enjoy its blessings. The benefits include fresher

food (picked by immigrant field hands, instead of by machine), more pliant

domestic service (provided by Mexican maids), smaller bills in restaurants

(with Salvadorans in the kitchen), and lower prices for new houses (because of

lower pay for the construction crew).<p>



<p>



<p>



Whom does that leave out? In Conner's view, those who pay the price are the

black teenagers, the white working-class fathers, the ambitious children of

maids and janitors, who are just as eager as any Vietnamese or Mexican to move

up the ladder but who find that the rungs have been knocked out. This is a

disaster for them but not, Conner says, for the classes that make the laws and

run the businesses.<p>



<p>



<p>



"If the illegal aliens were flooding into the legal, medical, educational, and

business occupations of this country, this problem would have received national

attention at the highest level and it would have been solved," the labor

economist Vernon Briggs, of Cornell University, has written. Lawrence Fuchs

says that according to public-opinion polls the college-educated are the only

group in favor of more immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



The economic argument against immigration is particularly troublesome for

liberals. It pits the rest of the world's poor against the two American groups

thought to have the most to lose from increased immigration: unionized labor,

which says its wage levels would be depressed, and young, unskilled blacks, who

would be nudged out of place for entry-level jobs.<p>



<p>



At this point, it is important to emphasize the distinction, not always clearly

stated, between legal and illegal immigration. If one were searching for the

pure immigrant spirit, the place to look would be among the illegals, for every

one of them has overcome some obstacle in order to be here. But because they

cannot compete fully in the aboveboard economy (they have no legal redress if

underpaid or mistreated; they have difficulty getting loans or rising into the

white-collar world), their climb up the occupational ladder ends early. More

important, from Conner's perspective, they put unfair pressure on the American

citizens competing for similar jobs. A man outside the law will accept working

conditions a citizen would not--and should not. Once the illegal immigrant has

the job, the citizen must choose between accepting similar conditions or going

without work.<p>



<p>



<p>



What kind of work do the illegals perform? According to some academic theory,

and to the folk wisdom of the Southwest, immigrants do the jobs that Americans

"won't" do. Michael Piore, an economist from MIT, has developed a model of a

"dual" labor market: some jobs are so dirty, so onerous, so poorly paid, that

if immigrants were not there to take them, the jobs would not exist. Therefore,

the immigrants who are filling them have not really displaced anyone else.<p>



<p>



<p>



"People say, 'Why aren't blacks like the Haitians?"' says T. Willard Fair, the

president of the Urban League of Greater Miami, where Haitians now hold many of

the maid and bellman jobs in which blacks once got their start. "'Why don't

they want to work?' The Haitians are behaving the way we did thirty years ago.

We would work for anything, take any abuse in the workplace."<p>



<p>



<p>



To most of those directly involved in the industries where illegal immigrants

concentrate, it seems obvious that no one else is lining up for the jobs. Last

December, Merle Linda Wolin, of The Wall Street Journal, went to see a number

of businesses where illegal immigrants had been rounded up during the spring of

1982 in Project Jobs, a short-lived sweep against employed illegal

immigrants.<p>

<p>



<p>



At a furniture factory in Santa Ana, California, on a railroad-construction

gang in Texas, in a food-processing plant in Chicago, and at other sites of

hard work, Wolin found that American citizens had in fact turned up for the

jobs when the immigrants were gone--but soon afterward, they had quit. The pay

was too bad; unemployment compensation was, by comparison, an attractive deal.

Former truck drivers and carpenters found it humiliating to sweep parking lots

or to keep up with a racing assembly line. By the time the *Journal's* reporter

arrived, six months after Project Jobs, the plants were again full of illegal

aliens. A team of researchers, headed by Wayne Cornelius, the director of the

Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego,

found a similar pattern in California. "The attitude of many young people is

that this is the dirty work of society," Cornelius has said, "and that people

born, brought up and educated in the U. S. shouldn't have to do it."<p>



<p>



<p>



What I learned on my tours over the same territory supported Cornelius's point.

At a packing house in San Antonio, for example, men grunted as they hauled

sides of meat from trucks into refrigerators. They disappeared as I, an Anglo

in a rented car, drove up; Project Jobs had struck here. The beefy, red-haired

foreman said that he'd be "happy" to have citizens in his work force if he

could get them. Of course, he had "no idea" whether there were any illegal

immigrants there. "It's against the law to ask." This is the convenient fiction

that permits many employers to hire an illegal work force and pretend they

haven't.<p>



<p>



<p>



The agricultural industry in California, Texas, and Florida depends more

heavily on illegal labor than any other industry does, and the growers have a

more fully developed self-justifying rationale. Many protect themselves by

saying they don't know who works for them, since the hiring is done by crew

chiefs, acting as "independent agents." In the Rio Grande Valley of Texas,

"independent" contracting means that people cross the river between 4 and 6

A.M. and stand near the bridges in Brownsville and Progreso, waiting for crew

chiefs to drive up and hire truckloads of workers for the day. In the inland

reaches of Texas and other large agricultural states, commuter labor is not so

feasible, and resident camps of illegal immigrants are an open secret. Growers

say they have no alternative: they need Mexicans (or, in Florida, Haitians) to

work the fields, because no one else would stick with the job. Americans can

get food stamps and live like kings on welfare, I was told by orange growers in

the Rio Grande Valley; but the Mexicans are grateful for the work. They are

even grateful for the piece-rate wages--40 cents for a bushel of cucumbers, 35

cents for a sack of oranges--that usually work out to well under the minimum

wage.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even Alfred Giugni, whose job is preventing illegal immigration, says the

growers may have a point. Giugni, a gigantic, mirthful man of mixed Italian and

Hawaiian parentage, is the district director of the Immigration and

Naturalization Service office in El Paso. "In the 1950s, the people picking

strawberries in Oregon were high school and college students," he says. "Now

they're Vietnamese and illegal Hispanics. The employers like it, because they

will work harder. Your high school student will work long enough to earn as

much money as he wants, and then he'll quit."<p>



<p>



<p>



In Houston, a city swollen with immigrants from the declining industrial cities

of Michigan and Indiana and the turbulent societies of Central and South

America, I spent several days talking with illegal immigrants from Mexico and

El Salvador. All had been successful by their own standards, but all operated

along the margin that separates jobs "with a future" from work Americans

"won't" do.<p>



<p>



<p>



One of the women was in her forties and was wearing a housekeeper's jacket from

an office-maintenance firm. She had been raised in El Salvador, and for several

years taught elementary school there. She came to the United States in 1970,

when she was in her late twenties, on a tourist visa. It expired after three

months, but she decided to stay. She began to work as a live-in maid for three

immigrant families who shared one house. Her pay was $40 a week plus room and

board. By 1974, she was earning $75 a week for the same work.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Next, I learn to drive, so I can make more money," she said. With more of the

city to choose her employers from, she was able to raise her rate to $125 a

week. "But I am so tired of living in. I look for other work." In 1977, she

found a job as a nighttime janitor--"bathroom lady"--in an office building.

After a month and a half there, "the company sees that I speak a little

English," she said. "They have other Latin people working there. They put me in

a supervisory position, give me $2.65 an hour. During the days, I still clean

house for $30 a day. I take the bus, and from six to ten in the evening I clean

the offices. I am working thirteen hours a day."<p>



<p>



<p>



She maintained this pace until 1981. As she had moved toward bigger, more

institutionalized employers, her treatment had improved, and she hoped to

continue that trend. She went to the employment manager at one of Houston's

best-known hotels and applied to be supervisor of the housekeeping staff. She

was eventually hired, and after several months moved to a similar position at a

new office center. She now earns and pays taxes on $18,000 a year. "Nobody ever

asks me for my paper," she says. "Never. But my wages are too low I take care

of a big place; I would be making more than $18,000 if I had my papers."<p>



<p>



<p>



I also met in Houston an eighteen-year-old with a tousle-haired country-boy

look, who was dressed in shiny black polyester trousers and a matching vest,

worn over a white-on-white shirt. He left his farming village in El Salvador

late in 1980, because, he said, "it is dangerous to be on either side." He took

buses through Guatemala and Mexico, offered *mordida*--bribes--of $10 and $20 a

shot to Mexican officials along the way, and reached the frontier near Nuevo

Laredo, Mexico, by the end of the year. He crossed the Rio Grande, which at

most places means nothing more than a wade, and hitchhiked out of Laredo to

Houston. He located friends from his village, lived with them, and found a job

at $3.40 an hour washing dishes in a well-known hotel. This wage was typical:

outside of agriculture and domestic service, I found almost no illegal

immigrants working for less than the federal minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, but

many working at the minimum or just above it.<p>



<p>



<p>



After a few days in the kitchen, the young man had heard enough from his

friends to believe that he could find a less grueling way to earn his money. He

found a job in a metal-pipe yard, which at least was outdoor work. He tried to

improve his English, and, although it is still not good, he was able to apply

for jobs in which he would deal with the public. He returned to the hotel,

where he now works as a bartender, earning $4.25 an hour.<p>



<p>



<p>



His companion, also from El Salvador, was a twenty-four-year-old with the

intense, committed look of a radical intellectual. Of the several dozen

Salvadorans I met in California and Texas, perhaps one quarter explained their

immigration in terms of political oppression and human rights. The rest said

they were hunting for work. This young man was one of the quarter. He said he

had reluctantly left his wife and child behind, because he was "Looking for a

country that would respect human rights." He took buses through Mexico until he

neared the U.S. border, then waded the Rio Grande near Brownsville. He worked

on farm-labor gangs on the vast, flat ranches of South Texas, hitched a ride to

Houston, and started as a minimum-wage dishwasher in a hotel, the job he still

holds. After he was established, he called for his wife to join him. She left

their first child at home with her parents. Their second child was born in

Houston late last year, a U. S. citizen.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



These dishwashers and maids think they are doing jobs most Americans would

refuse. But there is another view of illegal immigration: it holds that men and

women like those I met in Houston are displacing Americans, directly or

indirectly.<p>



<p>



<p>



Donald Huddle, of Rice University, contends that citizens do want the jobs

immigrants now hold. Huddle and other researchers surveyed the jobs that

illegal immigrants were holding when they were caught and found that they paid

from $4 to $9.50 an hour. He concluded, "These wages debunk the commonly held

notion that illegal aliens are taking only those jobs that Americans don't want

because they are so lowly paid." Vernon Briggs points out that in every broad

category of work in which illegal immigrants are found, most of the workers are

still American citizens. He says that therefore it is misleading to talk about

"immigrant work."<p>



<p>



<p>



A more fundamental objection raised to the "Americans won't do dirty work"

argument is that it ignores the dynamic aspect of economics. Perhaps it proves

nothing that citizens won't take the jobs now available in the packing house

and the tomato field; perhaps those jobs are dirty and low-paid precisely

because so much cheap labor is available to fill them. "If there were no

illegals," says Ray Marshall, "the jobs would be different."<p>



<p>



<p>



Businesses in the service sector, such as restaurants and hotels, would pass

along the modest additional cost of hiring legal help. Who would notice the

extra dollar on the dinner bill? Some farmers would be able to pass along the

extra cost of picking grapes or oranges; others would use labor more

efficiently or mechanize their fields.<p>



<p>



<p>



Still other businesses would fold, but for them the restrictionists shed no

tears. In part, they would be service "businesses," such as household help.

What would happen if the border were closed tomorrow? I asked Alfred Giugni, in

El Paso. "The only serious impact would be the maid situation," he said.

"Everything else would work out. You get the impression that the only maids who

are paid the minimum wage in El Paso are the ones who work for people in the

INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service]."<p>



<p>



<p>



The other likely casualties would be garment factories, leather works, and

other low-wage, labor-intensive businesses. "The jobs in which illegal aliens

are not displacing American workers are those jobs in which American industry

is competing with workers in newly developed countries," Dan Stein, an official

of FAIR, has written. America's future lies with a skillful work force and high

tech. "The fewer unskilled laborers there are in this country, the better off

we should be," Vernon Briggs says.<p>



<p>



<p>



In any case, Conner, Briggs, and others argue, it is a strange and greedy kind

of social arithmetic that tots up those who might hypothetically be hurt by

restriction but ignores those who are now paying the costs of uncontrolled

borders.<p>



<p>



<p>



Briggs notes government estimates that 29 million people, or nearly 30 percent

of the employed civilian labor force, work in what he calls "the kinds of

low-skilled industrial, service, and agricultural jobs in which illegal aliens

typically seek employment." He contends that "farm workers, dishwashers,

laborers, garbage collectors, building cleaners, restaurant employees,

gardeners, maintenance workers, to name a few occupations, perform useful and

often indispensable work. Unfortunately, their remuneration is often poor, in

part because there is a large pool of persons available for these jobs."<p>



<p>



"The victims of immigration are the marginal workers, with low education, who

may not be hot to work sixty hours a week," says Roger Conner. "My own life as

an employer teaches me that if an employer is looking for a minimum of hassle,

he will look past these people--unless he has a reason to have to make it work

with them. There is just enough truth to the notion that aliens make better

workers that it nourishes the stereotypes and creates a self-fulfilling

prophecy. One reason there are so few opportunities for young black people on

construction sites is that the aliens on the scene always have somebody

available to bring in with them."<p>



<p>



<p>



When Conner was a boy, in Dallas, his mother took in ironing and later did

domestic work. He cites today's counterparts of his younger self as among the

Americans the immigrant hurts. "To the extent that the initial targets of

immigrants tend to be unskilled jobs and low-skill entrepreneurial

opportunities--say a small construction company--those are the ways out of

poverty for the energetic American. The guy who wants to work his way up--to

him the immigrant is an obstacle. I would concede a gain in efficiency from

immigration, but the cost is what we lose in upward mobility from the lower

classes."<p>



<p>



<p>



Conner's "concession" distills the economic argument against immigration to its

pure form: immigrants can make the economy more efficient, but they can hurt

the American lower class. Is this grounds for closing the door? I believe

not.<p>



<p>



<p>



For one thing, the analysis may be totally incorrect. Sixty years ago,

Progressives and conservatives joined to oppose the New Immigration. The

Progressives based their argument on the damage done to America's poor. Robert

Hunter's *Poverty*, an influential Progressive tract, concluded that the

immigrant stood between the American workingman and a better life. The

Dillingham Commission, a government panel whose forty-two-volume study laid the

groundwork for the immigration laws of the 1920s, also said that immigrants

displaced American workers. Even so, the commission concluded that displaced

workers found better jobs in an expanding economy. Oscar Handlin has said of

its findings, "To the extent that immigrants contributed to that expansion,

they actually helped to lift the condition of the laborers they found already

there."<p>



<p>



<p>



Is it necessarily any different now? In Texas and California, Mexican-Americans

have been displaced by Mexican immigrants. Ricardo Romo, who teaches history at

the University of Texas, says that his parents were displaced from their

migrant laborers' jobs in South Texas. But "no one should assume that those who

leave are worse off than if they had stayed," he says. "In many cases, there is

substantial improvement when people move on. The kids go to better schools than

their parents, they get into skilled trades."<p>



<p>



<p>



Through the past decade, unemployment has been low in the very places where

immigration, legal and illegal, has been the greatest: California, Florida,

Texas. True, this is partly tautology--why would immigrants go where there were

no jobs? But it also suggests that a growing economy, even though washed by

waves of immigration, can create more opportunities for Americans than a

stagnant one that freezes competitors out.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Urban Institute's study of Southern California reported that the region's

unemployment rates for all races and age groups were lower than the national

average, and that the difference between rates for whites and for non-whites

was less than elsewhere. This was true though Southern California is rivaled

only by Miami in its concentration of immigrants and has a higher proportion of

illegals. "One can conclude that the large undocumented population in Los

Angeles did not increase unemployment among Hispanics or other groups in Los

Angeles," the report said.<p>



<p>



<p>



Even if the case against illegal immigrants is assumed to be true, is the

solution to shield the entire economy from the bracing effects of immigration?

Restrictionists often cite the case of Kemah, Texas, to suggest the tensions

that even legal immigrants create. In Kemah, the commercial fishermen who had

long worked the Gulf Coast found their waters dotted with Vietnamese in rival

boats. The Vietnamese were here legally, admitted as refugees. They had

scrimped, like the Nguyens, to lease or buy their fishing craft. The

working-class whites of the region had initially tolerated them. When the

Vietnamese "took low income jobs cleaning fish or working in restaurant

kitchens, they were acceptable," Paul D. Starr, a sociologist from Auburn

University, said recently in the Texas Observer. "But when they became

fishermen--and competitors--attitudes toward them changed....The unpleasant

fact is that the Vietnamese work harder and longer and under more difficult

conditions than do most Americans."<p>



<p>



<p>



The Vietnamese won, and American citizens lost--but they lost in the kind of

economic competition that is supposed to be the engine of capitalism. Should

the fishermen have been protected against the Vietnamese's willingness to work

longer hours? Are we ready to say that fair competition is too much for

Americans to withstand? Unless we are, there is no economic case against legal

immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



Unfair competition is something else. Illegal immigrants, however admirable as

individuals, are unfair rivals. They are often exploited, but that is not the

real inequity. After all, they are here by their own choice. They are most

unfair to the struggling Americans who hold similar jobs. Appreciating the

immigrants' adaptability, we should welcome their lawful presence. Can anyone

contend that what the Nguyen family enjoys it has "taken" from someone else?

But recognizing the barriers that the black teenager, the white laborer, and

the Mexican-American father confront, and the strains their frustration puts on

the entire society, we should attempt to ensure that less of America's

immigration takes place outside the law.<p>



<p>



<p>

LANGUAGE<p>



<p>



Assume for a moment that legal immigrants make an economy more efficient. Does

that tell us all we need to know in order to understand their impact on our

society? A national culture is held together by official rules and informal

signals. Through their language, dress, taste, and habits of life, immigrants

initially violate the rules and confuse the signals. The United States has

prided itself on building a nation out of diverse parts. *E Pluribus Unum*

originally referred to the act of political union in which separate colonies

became one sovereign state. It now seems more fitting as a token of the

cultural adjustments through which immigrant strangers have become Americans.

Can the assimilative forces still prevail?<p>



<p>



<p>



The question arises because most of today's immigrants share one trait: their

native language is Spanish.<p>



<p>



<p>



From 1970 to 1978, the three leading sources of legal immigrants to the U.S.

were Mexico, the Philippines, and Cuba. About 42 percent of legal immigration

during the seventies was from Latin America. It is thought that about half of

all illegal immigrants come from Mexico, and 10 to 15 percent more from

elsewhere in Latin America. Including illegal immigrants makes all figures

imprecise, but it seems reasonable to conclude that more than half the people

who now come to the United States speak Spanish. This is a greater

concentration of immigrants in one non-English language group than ever

before.<p>



<p>



<p>



Is it a threat? The conventional wisdom about immigrants and their languages is

that the Spanish-speakers are asking for treatment different from that which

has been accorded to everybody else. In the old days, it is said, immigrants

were eager to assimilate as quickly as possible. They were placed, sink or

swim, in English-language classrooms, and they swam. But now the Latin

Americans seem to be insisting on bilingual classrooms and ballots. "The

Hispanics demand that the United States become a bilingual country, with all

children entitled to be taught in the language of their heritage, at public

expense," Theodore White has written. Down this road lie the linguistic

cleavages that have brought grief to other nations.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is the way many people think, and this is the way I myself thought as I

began this project.<p>



<p>



<p>



The historical parallel closest to today's concentration of Spanish-speaking

immigrants is the German immigration of the nineteenth century. From 1830 to

1890, 4.5 million Germans emigrated to the United States, making up one third

of the immigrant total. The Germans recognized that command of English would

finally ensure for them, and especially for their children, a place in the

mainstream of American society. But like the Swedes, Dutch, and French before

them, they tried hard to retain the language in which they had been raised.<p>



<p>



<p>



The midwestern states, where Germans were concentrated, established bilingual

schools, in which children could receive instruction in German. In Ohio.

German-English public schools were in operation by 1840; in 1837, the

Pennsylvania legislature ordered that German-language public schools be

established on an equal basis with English-language schools. Minnesota,

Maryland, and Indiana also operated public schools in which German was used,

either by itself or in addition to English. In *Life with Two Languages,* his

study of bilingualism, Francois Grosjean says, "What is particularly striking

about German Americans in the nineteenth century is their constant efforts to

maintain their language, culture, and heritage. "<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet despite everything the Germans could do, their language began to die out.

The progression was slow and fraught with pain. For the immigrant, language was

the main source of certainty and connection to the past. As the children broke

from the Old World culture and tried out their snappy English slang on their

parents, the pride the parents felt at such achievements was no doubt mixed

with the bittersweet awareness that they were losing control.<p>



<p>

At first the children would act as interpreters for their parents; then they

would demand the independence appropriate to that role; then they would yearn

to escape the coarse ways of immigrant life. And in the end, they would be

Americans. It was hard on the families, but it built an assimilated

English-language culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



The pattern of assimilation is familiar from countless novels, as well as from

the experience of many people now living. Why, then, is the currently

fashionable history of assimilation so different? Why is it assumed, in so many

discussions of bilingual education, that in the old days immigrants switched

quickly and enthusiastically to English?<p>



<p>



<p>



One reason is that the experience of Jewish immigrants in the early twentieth

century was different from this pattern. German Jews, successful and thoroughly

assimilated here in the nineteenth century, oversaw an effort to bring Eastern

European Jews into the American mainstream as quickly as possible. In New York

City, the Lower East Side's Hebrew Institute, later known as the Educational

Alliance, defined its goal as teaching the newcomers "the privileges and duties

of American citizenship." Although many Jewish immigrants preserved their

Yiddish, Jews generally learned English faster than any other group.<p>



<p>



<p>



Another reason that nineteenth-century linguistic history is so little

remembered lies in the political experience of the early twentieth century. As

an endless stream of New Immigrants arrived from Eastern Europe, the United

States was awash in theories about the threats the newcomers posed to American

economic, sanitary, and racial standards, and the "100 percent Americanism"

movement arose. By the late 1880s, school districts in the Midwest had already

begun reversing their early encouragement of bilingual education. Competence in

English was made a requirement for naturalized citizens in 1906.

Pro-English-language leagues sprang up to help initiate the New Immigrants.

California's Commission on Immigration and Housing, for example, endorsed a

campaign of "Americanization propaganda " in light of "the necessity for all to

learn English--the language of America." With the coming of World War I, all

German-language activities were suddenly cast in a different light. Eventually

as a result, Americans came to believe that previous immigrants had speedily

switched to English, and to view the Hispanics' attachment to Spanish as a

troubling aberration.<p>

The term "Hispanic" is in many ways deceiving. It refers to those whose origins

can be traced back to Spain (Hispania) or Spain's former colonies. It makes a

bloc out of Spanish-speaking peoples who otherwise have little in common. The

Cuban-Americans, concentrated in Florida, are flush with success. Some of them

nurse dreams of political revenge against Castro. They demonstrate little

solidarity with such other Hispanics as the Mexican-Americans of Texas, who are

much less estranged from their homeland and who have been longtime participants

in the culture of the Southwest. The Cuban-Americans tend to be Republicans;

most Mexican-Americans and Puerto Ricans are Democrats. The Puerto Ricans, who

are U.S. citizens from birth, and who have several generations of contact with

American city life behind them, bear little resemblance to the Salvadorans and

Guatemalans now pouring northward to get out of the way of war. Economically,

the Puerto Ricans of New York City have more in common with American blacks

than with most other Hispanic groups. Such contact as Anglo and black residents

of Boston and New York have with Hispanic life comes mainly through Puerto

Ricans; they may be misled about what to expect from the Mexicans and Central

Americans arriving in ever increasing numbers. Along the southern border,

Mexican-American children will razz youngsters just in from Mexico. A newcomer

is called a "T.J," for Tijuana; it is the equivalent of "hillbilly" or

"rube."<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, "Hispanic" can be a useful word, because it focuses attention on the

major question about this group of immigrants: Will their assimilation into an

English-speaking culture be any less successful than that of others in the

past?<p>



<p>



<p>



To answer, we must consider what is different now from the circumstances under

which the Germans, Poles, and Italians learned English.<p>



<p>



<p>



The most important difference is that the host country is right next door. The

only other non-English-speaking group for which this is true is the

French-Canadians. Proximity has predictable consequences. For as long as the

Southwest has been part of the United States, there has been a border culture

in which, for social and commercial reasons, both languages have been used.

There has also been a Mexican-American population accustomed to moving freely

across the border, between the cultures, directing its loyalties both ways.<p>



<p>



<p>



Because it has always been so easy to go home, many Mexicans and

Mexican-Americans have displayed the classic sojourner outlook. The more total

the break with the mother country, the more pressure immigrants feel to adapt;

but for many immigrants from Mexico, whose kin and friends still live across

the border and whose dreams center on returning in wealthy splendor to their

native villages, the pressure is weak.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many people have suggested that there is another difference, perhaps more

significant than the first. It is a change in the nation's self-confidence. The

most familiar critique of bilingual education holds that the nation no longer

feels a resolute will to require mastery of the national language. America's

most powerful assimilative force, the English language, may therefore be in

jeopardy.<p>



<p>



<p>



It is true that starting in the early 1960s U.S. government policy began to

move away from the quick-assimilation approach preferred since the turn of the

century. After surveys of Puerto Rican students in New York City and

Mexican-Americans in Texas revealed that they were dropping out of school early

and generally having a hard time, educational theorists began pushing plans for

Spanish-language instruction. The turning point came with *Lau v. Nichols,* a

case initiated in 1971 by Chinese-speaking students in San Francisco. They sued

for "equal protection," on grounds that their unfamiliarity with English denied

them an adequate education. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled in their favor,

saying that "those who do not understand English are certain to find their

classroom experience wholly incomprehensible and in no way meaningful." The

ruling did not say that school systems had to start bilingual programs of the

kind that the phrase is now generally understood to mean--that is, classrooms

in which both languages are used. The court said that "teaching English to the

students...who do not speak the language" would be one acceptable solution. But

the federal regulations and state laws that implemented the decision obliged

many districts to set up the system of "transitional" bilingual education that

has since become the focus of furor.<p>



<p>



<p>



The rules vary from state to state, but they typically require a school

district to set up a bilingual program whenever a certain number of students

(often twenty) at one grade level are from one language group and do not speak

English well. In principle, bilingual programs will enable them to keep up with

the content of, say, their math and history courses while preparing them to

enter the English-language classroom.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



The bilingual system is accused of supporting a cadre of educational

consultants while actually retarding the students' progress into the

English-speaking mainstream. In this view, bilingual education could even be

laying the foundation for a separate Hispanic culture, by extending the

students' Spanish-language world from their homes to their schools.<p>



<p>



<p>



Before I traveled to some of the schools in which bilingual education was

applied, I shared the skeptics' view. What good could come of a system that

encouraged, to whatever degree, a language other than the national tongue? But

after visiting elementary, junior high, and high schools in Miami, Houston, San

Antonio, Austin, several parts of Los Angeles, and San Diego, I found little

connection between the political debate over bilingual education and what was

going on in these schools.<p>



<p>



To begin with, one central fact about bilingual education goes largely

unreported. It is a temporary program. The time a typical student stays in the

program varies from place to place--often two years in Miami, three years in

Los Angeles--but when that time has passed, the student will normally leave.

Why, then, do bilingual programs run through high school? Those classes are

usually for students who are new to the district--usually because their parents

are new to the country.<p>



<p>



<p>



There is another fact about bilingual education, more difficult to prove but

impressive to me, a hostile observer. Most of the children I saw were

unmistakably learning to speak English.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the elementary schools, where the children have come straight out of

all-Spanish environments, the background babble seems to be entirely in

Spanish. The kindergarten and first- to third-grade classrooms I saw were

festooned with the usual squares and circles cut from colored construction

paper, plus posters featuring Big Bird and charts about the weather and the

seasons. Most of the schools seemed to keep a rough balance between English and

Spanish in the lettering around the room; the most Spanish environment I saw

was in one school in East Los Angeles, where about a third of the signs were in

English.<p>



<p>



<p>



The elementary school teachers were mostly Mexican-American women. They

prompted the children with a mixture of English and Spanish during the day.

While books in both languages are available in the classrooms, most of the

first-grade reading drills I saw were in Spanish. In theory, children will

learn the phonetic principle of reading more quickly if they are not trying to

learn a new language at the same time. Once comfortable as readers, they will

theoretically be able to transfer their ability to English.<p>



<p>



<p>



In a junior high school in Houston, I saw a number of Mexican and Salvadoran

students in their "bilingual" biology and math classes. They were drilled

entirely in Spanish on the parts of an amoeba and on the difference between a

parallelogram and a rhombus. When students enter bilingual programs at this

level, the goal is to keep them current with the standard curriculum while

introducing them to English. I found my fears of linguistic separatism

rekindled by the sight of fourteen-year-olds lectured to in Spanish. I reminded

myself that many of the students I was seeing had six months earlier lived in

another country.<p>



<p>



<p>



The usual next stop for students whose time in bilingual education is up is a

class in intensive English, lasting one to three hours a day. These students

are divided into two or three proficiency levels, from those who speak no

English to those nearly ready to forgo special help. In Houston, a teacher

drilled two-dozen high-school-age Cambodians, Indians, Cubans, and Mexicans on

the crucial difference between the voiced *th* sound of "this" and the

voiceless *th* of "thing." In Miami, a class of high school sophomores included

youths from Cuba, El Salvador, and Honduras. They listened as their teacher

read a Rockwellesque essay about a student with a crush on his teacher, and

then set to work writing an essay of their own, working in words like

"Garrulous" and "sentimentalize."<p>



<p>



<p>



One of the students in Miami, a sixteen-year-old from Honduras, said that his

twelve-year-old brother had already moved into mainstream classes. Linguists

say this is the standard pattern for immigrant children. The oldest children

hold on to their first language longest, while their younger sisters and

brothers swim quickly into the new language culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



The more I saw of the classes, the more convinced I became that most of the

students were learning English. Therefore, I started to wonder what it is about

bilingual education that has made it the focus of such bitter disagreement.<p>



<p>



<p>



For one thing, most immigrant groups other than Hispanics take a comparatively

dim view of bilingual education. Haitians, Vietnamese, and Cambodians are

eligible for bilingual education, but in general they are unenthusiastic. In

Miami, Haitian boys and girls may learn to read in Creole rather than English.

Still, their parents push to keep them moving into English. "A large number of

[Haitian] parents come to the PTA meetings, and they don't want interpreters,"

said the principal of Miami's Edison Park Elementary School last spring. They

want to learn English. They don't want notices coming home in three languages.

When they come here, unless there is total non-communication, they will try to

get through to us in their broken English. The students learn the language very

quickly."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



Bilingual education is inflammatory in large part because of what it

symbolizes, not because of the nuts and bolts of its daily operation. In

reality, bilingual programs move students into English with greater or lesser

success; in reality, most Spanish-speaking parents understand that mastery of

English will be their children's key to mobility. But in the political arena,

bilingual education presents a different face. To the Hispanic ideologue, it is

a symbol of cultural pride and political power. And once it has been presented

that way, with full rhetorical flourish, it naturally strikes other Americans

as a threat to the operating rules that have bound the country together.<p>



<p>



<p>



Once during the months I spoke with and about immigrants I felt utterly

exasperated. It was while listening to two Chicano activist lawyers in Houston

who demanded to know why their people should be required to learn English at

all. "It is unrealistic to think people can learn it that quickly," one lawyer

said about the law that requires naturalized citizens to pass a test in

English. Especially when they used to own this part of the country, and when

Spanish was the historic language of this region."<p>



<p>



<p>



There is a historic claim for Spanish--but by the same logic there is a

stronger claim for, say, Navajo as the historic language of the Southwest. The

truth is that for more than a century the territory has been American and its

national language has been English.<p>



<p>



<p>



I felt the same irritation welling up when I talked with many bilingual

instructors and policy-makers. Their arguments boiled down to: What's so

special about English? They talked about the richness of the bilingual

experience, the importance of maintaining the children's abilities in

Spanish--even though when I watched the instructors in the classroom I could

see that they were teaching principally English.<p>



<p>



<p>



In my exasperation, I started to think that if such symbols of the dignity of

language were so provocative to me, a comfortable member of the least-aggrieved

ethnic group, it might be worth reflecting on the comparable sensitivities that

lie behind the sentiments of the Spanish-speaking.<p>



<p>



<p>



Consider the cases of Gloria Ramirez and Armandina Flores, who taught last year

in the bilingual program at the Guerra Elementary School, in the Edgewood

Independent School District, west of San Antonio.<p>



<p>



<p>



San Antonio has evaded questions about the balance between rich and poor in its

school system by carving the city up into independent school districts. Alamo

Heights is the winner under this approach, and Edgewood is the loser. The

Edgewood School District is perennially ranked as one of the poorest in the

state. The residents are almost all Mexican-Americans or Mexicans. It is a

settled community, without much to attract immigrants, but many stop there

briefly on their way somewhere else, enough to give Edgewood a sizable

illegal-immigrant enrollment.<p>



<p>



<p>



In the middle of a bleak, sun-baked stretch of fields abutting a commercial

vegetable farm, and within earshot of Kelly Air Force Base, sits Edgewood's

Guerra School. It is an ordinary-looking but well-kept one-story structure that

was built during the Johnson Administration. Nearly all the students are

Mexican or Mexican-American.<p>



<p>



<p>



Gloria Ramirez, who teaches first grade, is a compact, attractive woman of

thirty-three, a no-nonsense veteran of the activist movements of the 1960s.

Armandina Flores, a twenty-seven-year-old kindergarten teacher, is a beauty

with dark eyes and long hair. During classroom hours, they deliver "Now,

children" explanations of what is about to happen in both Spanish and English,

although when the message really must get across, it comes in Spanish.<p>



<p>



<p>



Both are remarkable teachers. They have that spark often thought to be missing

in the public schools. There is no hint that for them this is just a job,

perhaps because it symbolizes something very different from the worlds in which

they were raised.<p>



<p>



<p>



Gloria Ramirez was born in Austin, in 1950. Both of her parents are native

Texans, as were two of her grandparents, but her family, like many other

Mexican-American families, "spoke only Spanish when I was growing up," she

says. None of her grandparents went to school at all. Her parents did not go

past the third grade. Her father works as an auto-body mechanic; her mother

raised the six children, and recently went to work at Austin State Hospital as

a cleaner.<p><p>



<p>



Ramirez began learning English when she started school; but the school, on

Austin's east side, was overwhelmingly Mexican-American, part of the same

culture she'd always known. The big change came when she was eleven. Her family

moved to a working-class Anglo area in South Austin. She and her brother were

virtually the only Mexican-Americans at the school. There was no more Spanish

on the playground, or even at home. "My parents requested that we speak more

English to them from then on," she says. "Both of them could speak it, but

neither was comfortable."<p>



<p>



<p>



"Before then, I didn't realize I had an accent. I didn't know until a teacher

at the new school pointed it out in a ridiculing manner. I began learning

English out of revenge." For six years, she took speech classes. "I worked hard

so I could sound--like this," she says in standard American. She went to the

University of Texas, where she studied history and philosophy and became

involved in the Mexican-American political movements of the 1970s. She taught

bilingual-education classes in Boston briefly before coming home to Texas.<p>



<p>



<p>



Armandina Flores was born in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico, across the river from Del

Rio, Texas. Her mother, who was born in Houston, was an American citizen, but

her parents had returned to Mexico a few months after her birth, and she had

never learned English. Flores's father was a Mexican citizen. When she reached

school age, she began commuting across the river to a small Catholic school in

Del Rio, where all the other students were Chicano. When she was twelve and

about to begin the sixth grade, her family moved to Del Rio and she entered an

American public school.<p>



<p>



<p>



At that time, the sixth grade was divided into tracks, which ran from 6-1 at

the bottom to 6-12. Most of the Anglos were at the top; Armandina Flores was

initially placed in 6-4. She showed an aptitude for English and was moved up to

6-8. Meanwhile, her older sister, already held back once, was in 6-2. Her

parents were proud of Armandina's progress; they began to depend on her English

in the family's dealings in the Anglo world. She finished high school in Del

Rio, went to Our Lady of the Lake College in San Antonio, and came to Edgewood

as an aide in 1978, when she was twenty-two.<p>



<p>



<p>



Considered one way, these two stories might seem to confirm every charge made

by the opponents of bilingual education. Through the trauma of being plucked

from her parents' comfortable Spanish-language culture and plunged into the

realm of public language, Gloria Ramirez was strengthened, made a cosmopolitan

and accomplished person. Her passage recalls the one Richard Rodriguez

describes in *Hunger of Memory,* an autobiography that has become the most

eloquent text for opponents of bilingual programs.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Without question, it would have pleased me to hear my teachers address me in

Spanish when I entered the classroom," Rodriguez wrote. "I would have felt much

less afraid....But I would have delayed--for how long postponed?--having to

learn the language of public society."<p>



<p>



<p>



Gloria Ramirez concedes that the pain of confused ethnicity and lost loyalties

among Mexican-Americans is probably very similar to what every other immigrant

group has endured. She even admits that she was drawn to bilingual education

for political as well as educational reasons. As for Armandina Flores, hers is

a calmer story of successful assimilation, accomplished without the crutch of

bilingual education.<p>



<p>



<p>



Yet both of these women insist, with an edge to their voices, that their

students are fortunate not to have the same passage awaiting them.<p>



<p>



<p>



It was a very wasteful process, they say. They swam; many others sank. "You

hear about the people who make it, but not about all the others who dropped

out, who never really learned," Ramirez says. According to the Mexican-American

Legal Defense and Education Fund, 40 percent of Hispanic students drop out

before they finish high school, three times as many as among Anglo students.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Many people around here don't feel comfortable with themselves in either

language," Ramirez says. Flores's older sister never became confident in

English; "she feels like a lower person for it." She has just had a baby and is

anxious that he succeed in English. Ramirez's older brother learned most of his

English in the Marines. He is married to a Mexican immigrant and thinks that it

is very important that their children learn English. And that is more likely to

happen, the teachers say, if they have a transitional moment in Spanish.<p>



<p>



<p>



Otherwise, "a child must make choices that concern his survival," Ramirez says,

"He can choose to learn certain words, only to survive; but it can kill his

desire to learn, period. Eventually he may be able to deal in the language, but

he won't be educated." If the natural-immersion approach worked, why, they ask,

would generation after generation of Chicanos, American citizens living

throughout the Southwest, have lived and died without ever fully moving into

the English-language mainstream?<p>



<p>



<p>



These two teachers, and a dozen others with parallel experience, might be wrong

in their interpretation of how bilingual education works. If so, they are

making the same error as German, Polish, and Italian immigrants. According to

the historians hired by the Select Commission, "Immigrants argued, when given

the opportunity, that the security provided them by their cultures eased rather

than hindered the transition." Still, there is room for reasonable disagreement

about the most effective techniques for bringing children into English. A

former teacher named Robert Rossier, for example, argues from his experience

teaching immigrants that intensive courses in English are more effective than a

bilingual transition. Others line up on the other side.<p>



<p>



<p>



But is this not a question for factual resolution rather than for battles about

linguistic and ethnic pride? Perhaps one approach will succeed for certain

students in certain situations and the other will be best for others. The

choice between bilingual programs and intensive-English courses, then, should

be a choice between methods, not ideologies. The wars over bilingual education

have had a bitter, symbolic quality. Each side has invested the issue with a

meaning the other can barely comprehend. To most Mexican-American parents and

children, bilingual education is merely a way of learning English; to Hispanic

activists, it is a symbol that they are at last taking their place in the sun.

But to many other Americans, it sounds like a threat not to assimilate.<p>



<p>



It is easy for Americans to take for granted, or fail to appreciate, the

strength of American culture," says Henry Cisneros, the mayor of San Antonio.

Cisneros is the first Mexican-American mayor of the country's most heavily

Hispanic major city, a tall, grave man of thirty-six who is as clear a

demonstration of the possibilities of ethnic assimilation as John Kennedy was.

Cisneros gives speeches in Spanish and in English. Over the door that leads to

his chambers, gilt letters spell out "Office of the Mayor" and, underneath,

"Oficina den Alcalde." "I'm talking about TV programs, McDonald's, automobiles,

the Dallas Cowboys. It is very pervasive. Mexican-Americans like the American

way of life."<p>



<p>



<p>



"These may sound like just the accouterments," Cisneros says. "I could also

have mentioned due process of law; relations with the police; the way

supermarkets work; the sense of participation, especially now that more and

more Mexican-Americans are in positions of leadership. All of the things that

shape the American way of life are indomitable."<p>



<p>



<p>



In matters of civic culture, many Mexican-Americans, especially in Texas, act

as custodians of the values the nation is said to esteem. They emphasize

family, church, and patriotism of the most literal sort, expressed through

military service. In the shrine-like position of honor in the sitting room. the

same place where black families may have portraits of John F. Kennedy or Martin

Luther King, a Mexican-American household in Texas will display a picture of

the son or nephew in the Marines. Every time I talked with a Mexican-American

about assimilation and separatism I heard about the Mexican-American heroes and

martyrs who have served in the nation's wars.<p>



<p>



<p>



All the evidence suggests that Hispanics are moving down the path toward

assimilation. According to a survey conducted in 1982 by Rodolfo de la Garza

and Robert Brischetto for the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project,

11 percent of Chicanos (including a large number of illegal immigrants) were

unable to speak English. The younger the people, the more likely they were to

speak English. Ninety-four percent of those between the ages of eighteen and

twenty-five could speak English, versus 78 percent of those aged sixty-six to

eighty-seven. Not surprisingly the English-speakers were better educated, had

better jobs. and were less likely to have two foreign-born parents than the

Spanish-speakers.<p>



<p>



<p>



The details of daily life in Hispanic centers confirm these findings. The first

impression of East Los Angeles or Little Havana is of ubiquitous Spanish, on

the billboards and in the air. The second glance reveals former Chicano

activists, now in their late thirties, bemused that their children have not

really learned Spanish, or second-generation Cubans who have lost interest in

liberating the motherland or in being Cubans at all.<p>



<p>



<p>



Ricardo Romo says that when he taught Chicano studies at UCLA, his graduate

students would go into the San Antonio *barrio* but could not find their way

around, so much had they lost touch with the Spanish language. At a birthday

party for a Chicano intellectual in Texas, amid *pinatas* and plates laden with

*fajitas,* a birthday cake from a bakery was unveiled. It said "Happy Birthday"

in Spanish--misspelled. There was pathos in that moment, but it was pathos that

countless Italians, Poles, and Jews might understand.<p>



<p>



<p>



With Mexico next door to the United States, the Mexican-American culture will

always be different from that of other ethnic groups. Spanish will be a living

language in the United States longer than any other alternative to English. But

the movement toward English is inescapable.<p>



<p><p>



<p>



<p>



In only one respect does the Hispanic impulse seem to me to lead in a dangerous

direction. Hispanics are more acutely aware than most Anglos that, as a

practical reality, English is the national language of commerce, government,

and mobility. But some have suggested that, in principle, it should not be this

way.<p>



<p>



<p>



They invoke the long heritage of Mexican-Americans in the Southwest. As

"Californios" or "Tejanos," the ancestors of some of these families lived on

and owned the territory before the Anglo settlers. Others came across at the

turn of the century, at a time of Mexican upheaval; still others came during

the forties and fifties, as workers. They have paid taxes, fought in wars, been

an inseparable part of the region's culture. Yet they were also subject to a

form of discrimination more casual than the segregation of the Old South, but

having one of the same effects. Because of poverty or prejudice or

gerrymandered school districts, many Mexican-Americans were, in effect, denied

education. One result is that many now in their fifties and sixties do not

speak English well. Still, they are citizens, with the right of citizens to

vote. How are they to exercise their right if to do so requires learning

English? Do they not deserve a ballot printed in a language they can

understand?<p>



<p>



<p>



In the early seventies, the issue came before the courts, and several decisions

held that if voters otherwise eligible could not understand English, they must

have voting materials prepared in a more convenient language. In 1976, the

Voting Rights Act amendments said that there must be bilingual ballots if more

than 5 percent of the voters in a district were members of a "language minority

group." The only language minority groups" eligible under this ruling were

American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian-Americans (most significantly, Chinese

and Filipinos), and Spanish-speakers. A related case extracted from the Sixth

Circuit Court of Appeals the judgment that "the national language of the United

States is English."<p>



<p>



<p>



So it is that ballots in parts of the country are printed in Spanish, or

Chinese, or Tagalog, along with English. This is true even though anyone

applying for naturalization must still pass an English-proficiency test, which

consists of questions such as "What are the three branches of government?" and

"How long are the terms of a U.S. Senator and member of Congress?" The apparent

inconsistency reflects the linguistic reality that many native-born citizens

have not learned the national language.<p>



<p>



<p>



By most accounts, the bilingual ballot is purely a symbol. The native-born

citizens who can't read English often can't read Spanish, either. As a symbol,

it points in the wrong direction, away from a single national language in which

the public business will be done. Its only justification is the older

generation, which was excluded from the schools. In principle, then, it should

be phased out in several years.<p>



<p>



<p>



But there are those who feel that even the present arrangement is too onerous.

Rose Matsui Ochi, an assistant to the mayor of Los Angeles, who served on the

Select Commission, dissented from the commission's recommendation to keep the

English-language requirement for citizenship. She wrote in her minority

opinion, "Abolishing the requirement recognizes the inability of certain

individuals to learn English." Cruz Reynoso, the first Mexican-American

appointee to the California Supreme Court, was also on the Select Commission,

and he too dissented. America is a political union--not a cultural, linguistic,

religious or racial union," he wrote. "Of course, we as individuals would urge

all to learn English, for that is the language used by most Americans, as well

as the language of the marketplace. But we should no more demand

English-language skills for citizenship than we should demand uniformity of

religion. That a person wants to become a citizen and will make a good citizen

is more than enough."<p>



<p>



<p>



Some Chicano activists make the same point in less temperate terms. Twice I

found myself in shouting matches with Mexican-Americans who asked me who I

thought I was to tell them--after all the homeboys who had died in combat,

after all the insults they'd endured on the playground for speaking

Spanish--what language they "should" speak.<p>



<p>



<p>



That these arguments were conducted in English suggests the theoretical nature

of the debate. Still, in questions like this, symbolism can be crucial. "I have

sympathy for the position that the integrating mechanism of a society is

language," Henry Cisneros says. "The U.S. has been able to impose fewer such

integrating mechanisms on its people than other countries, but it needs some

tie to hold these diverse people, Irish, Jews, Czechs, together as a nation.

Therefore, I favor people learning English and being able to conduct business

in the official language of the country."<p>



<p>



<p>



"The *unum* demands only certain things of the *pluribus,*" Lawrence Fuchs

says. "It demands very little. It demands that we believe in the political

ideals of the republic, which allows people to preserve their ethnic identity.

Most immigrants come from repressive regimes: we say, we're asking you to

believe that government should not oppress you. Then it only asks one other

thing: that in the wider marketplace and in the civic culture, you use the

official language. No other society asks so little.<p>



<p>



<p>



"English is not just an instrument of mobility. It is a sign that you really

are committed. If you've been here five years, which you must to be a citizen,

and if you are reasonably young, you should be able to learn English in that

time. The rest of us are entitled to that." <p>



<p>



<p>



Most of the young people I met--the rank and file, not the intellectuals who

espouse a bilingual society-- seemed fully willing to give what in Fuchs's view

the nation asks. I remember in particular one husky Puerto Rican athlete at

Miami Senior High School who planned to join the Navy after he got his diploma.

I talked to him in a bilingual classroom, heard his story, and asked his name.

He told me, and I wrote "Ramon." He came around behind me and looked at my pad.

"No, no!" he told me. "You should have put R-A-Y-M-O-N-D. "<p>

<p>



RACE<p>



<p>



In much of the world, political boundaries reflect ethnic divisions that have

endured for thousands of years. Something more than loyalty to a political

system is involved in being a German, a Thai, or a Japanese. Japan, in fact,

refused to accept more than a few thousand Indochinese refugees, primarily on

the grounds that so alien an element could never be absorbed. But the United

States has enshrined the idea that ethnic origins may be surmounted or, better

still, ignored. Once Englishmen, Africans, Turks, we are all Americans now.<p>



<p>



<p>



The glory of American society is its melding of many peoples. But that has

never been an easy process. Few threads run more consistently through American

social history than concern about racial and ethnic change. Since colonial

days, members of successive ethnic groups have warned that the American

national character, embodied by their group, was endangered by incoming aliens.

The roster of groups that represent the "American" character has slowly

expanded: the original British and Dutch Protestants have been joined by

Catholics and Jews, Central and Eastern Europeans, and, most slowly and

arduously of all, people of color.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although ethnic concerns obviously remain on Americans' minds, our public

language lacks polite ways to express them. The U.S. must rely on political and

linguistic terms when it attempts to discuss the complicated web of relations

that constitute a society; it has no acceptable language with which to express

concern about changes in the ethnic makeup. Mexicans may complain that gringo

tourists have changed the character of Mexican resorts, and Saudi Arabians may

worry about the effects of American expatriates on their culture. Everyone

concedes that there is a Mexican or a Saudi character, and that Americans do

not have it. But when Americans attempt to talk about the effect of Mexican

immigrants on American society, the only terms that seem to be available are

those of racism. The exhortation inscribed on the Statue of Liberty contains no

notion of degree, no hint that immigration could change American society too

much or too fast.<p>



<p>



<p>



The United States has faced this issue once before. Its response to the New

Immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe at the turn of the century was

very different from the anti-immigrant feelings of the previous fifty years.

Nativist groups had complained about the Germans and especially the Irish

during the mid-nineteenth century, but there were few suggestions that they

were racially defective. The hostility to Italians, Slavs, and Eastern European

Jews, in contrast, was explicitly racial.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Dillingham Commission, the official government body whose research paved

the way for the national-origins quota system, published a "Dictionary of

Races" as part of the scientific findings it released in 1910. The purpose of

the dictionary, its authors said, was to ascertain "whether there may not be

certain races that are inferior to other races...to discover some test to show

whether some may be better fitted for American citizenship than others." The

experts who oversaw the dictionary's preparation, according to Oscar Handlin's

*Race and Nationality in American Life,* "agreed that there were innate,

ineradicable race distinctions that separated groups of men from one another,

and they agreed also as to the general necessity of classifying these races to

know which were fittest, most worthy of survival."<p>



<p>



<p>



By "race," these nativist intellectuals meant what would now be called

ethnicity. In 1916, a New York socialite and scientist named Madison Grant

published a book called *The Passing of the Great Race.* Grant's insight was

that the European population might be divided into three distinct races. The

Nordic race, the source of America's original British and German immigrants,

was, "all over the world, a race of soldiers, sailors, adventurers, and

explorers, but above all, of rulers, organizers and aristocrats...." The other

two European races, the Alpine and the Mediterranean, were heavily represented

in the New Immigration and were deficient in various ways. In the same spirit,

Francis A. Walker, then president of MIT, said that the New Immigrants were

"beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle

for existence...They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which...belong to

those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak trees of old

Germany to make laws and choose chieftains."<p>



<p>



<p>



Most of the quack-scientific theories used to prove the racial inferiority of

the New Immigrants make for easy sport these days. Almost no one is contending

that today's new immigrants are drawn from defective stock. If anything, the

complaint from those who must compete against them is that they are too well

equipped in the struggle for economic survival. The only group to earn

widespread opprobrium was the several thousand Cubans who were released from

prisons and mental hospitals in 1980 and sent to Miami as a small but very

noticeable part of the Mariel boatlift.<p>



<p>



<p>



While the central thesis of "racial" inferiority has no clear counterpart in

today's immigration debates, the sense of unease about racial and ethnic

differences does. The concerns Americans expressed about the New Immigration

help clarify our responses to the immigration now under way.<p>



<p>



<p>



The turn-of-the-century restrictionists agreed on a premise that seemed so

obvious to them that it was often left unstated. The premise was that different

races had certain ineradicable traits. Observe the Italian peasant in Calabria,

the Jewish peddler in Minsk, and you have seen the future of these "races" in

America, the argument went. The presumed effects on American culture ranged

from a greater dependence on central government to a reduction in the average

American's height.<p>



<p>



As post-melting-pot sociologists remind us, American ethnic groups are

different from one another. They have different religious preferences,

different eating and drinking habits, different patterns of economic success.

Ethnic identification affects our political behavior: American foreign policy,

for example, would be different if it were simply "American," and not an

amalgamation of Irish-American, Greek-American, Polish-American,

Jewish-American, Cuban-American, Afro-American, Italian-American, etc.,

views.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some people therefore wonder about the directions in which today's new groups

will push tomorrow's American culture. For example, Griffin Smith, an attorney

who is writing a book about immigration, points out that the English word

"representative" and the Spanish word "delegado" appear side by side on the

Texas ballot. "The English word exists in a matrix of history and tradition

that the Spanish counterpart does not altogether share....Whatever else Spain

gave to the New World, a sound political tradition was not high on the list.

Immigration from Latin America brings with it that tradition and culture." <p>



<p>



<p>



A theme in the early literature of restriction as strong as that of the

ineradicability of ethnic traits was the idea that Americans' land was no

longer their own, that foreign-looking people speaking foreign tongues had

usurped territory that once was comfortable and familiar. In his influential

book *Poverty,* published in 1904, the Progressive reformer Robert Hunter

wrote,<p>



<p>



"To live in one of these foreign communities [within American cities] is

actually to live on foreign soil. The thoughts, feelings, and traditions...are

often entirely alien to an American. The newspapers, the literature, the

ideals, the passions, the things which agitate the community, are unknown to us

except in fragments. During the meat riots on the east side of New York City

two years ago, I could understand nothing....A few years ago, when living in

Chicago in a colony of Bohemians and Hungarians who had been thrown out of

employment by the closing of a great industry...I felt the unrest, the

denunciation, the growing brutality but I was unable to discuss with them their

grievances, to sympathize with them, or to oppose them. I was an utter stranger

in my own city."<p>



<p>



<p>



With minor alterations for local geography and updating of the ethnic groups,

this might be the lament of English-speaking whites of Miami in the 1980s, or

of the black and white populations of Los Angeles, confronting their newly

polyglot city.<p>



<p>



<p>



Robert Hunter and his contemporaries had far more reason to feel like strangers

in their own land than most Americans do now. In their day the flow of

immigrants was far heavier, in both absolute and relative terms. Moreover, the

immigrants who were arriving in such numbers seemed more alien than even the

Cambodians and Salvadorans who have come during the 1980s. "The people who

opposed their entry--and they were more numerous and vociferous and seem to

have felt even more threatened than now--made the point that Catholics and Jews

were radically different," says Lawrence Fuchs, speaking of the New Immigration

era.<p>

<p>



<p>



Certain parts of the United States have recently felt a localized impact

approximating that of the New Immigration. First on the list would be southern

Florida, which received the 125,000 Cuban and Haitian "special entrants" in the

course of one year; second, Los Angeles; and third, cities along the Mexican

border, such as Laredo and Del Rio, where the human ripples from Mexico's

economic catastrophe first touched the United States.<p>



<p>



<p>



But through most of the country, the immigration of the past ten years has

meant a gradual change in proportions, rather than the introduction of

startlingly different populations that was so troubling early in the century.

Most Asian immigrants are concentrated in the western states, with nearly a

third of the nation's total in California alone. Although Asians are

increasingly numerous in California, they have been an evident part of the

state's population since the mid-nineteenth century, when Chinese contract

laborers were admitted to work on the railroads. Although Latin American

immigrants now also congregate in Chicago, Boston, New York, and other northern

cities, the greatest numbers of them have settled in the same southwestern

states where Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are part of the traditional ethnic

mix. Neither the Asian nor the Mexican ethnic group has always been welcomed by

the white majorities in these areas--the Chinese were the targets of

exclusionary laws in the nineteenth century--but they have been there through

the years, and their presence presumably blunts the shock effect of additional

immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



In short, historical comparison suggests that today's immigration should not

seem as threatening as the New Immigration did. The country was able to

overcome that great dislocation; will it not overcome this one? There is an

important qualifier to the confident assumption that it will, however.

Precisely because the warnings issued by the racial theorists were taken

seriously, the New Immigration came to an abrupt halt. With the passage of the

national-origins law of 1924, the ethnic balance of the American population was

supposed to be preserved. With the coming of the Depression, immigration ceased

to be an issue at all; during the 1930s, more people left the United States

than entered it. For more than forty years, until the immigration reforms of

1966, the U.S. had what Roger Conner, of FAIR, calls a "breathing space." The

cycles of the assimilative process were able to run undisturbed for more than a

generation, slowly bringing the masses of New Immigrants into American

culture.<p>



<p>



<p>



Now there is no let-up in sight. Therefore, if there were signs that the

assimilative process was breaking down-- that immigrants were not learning

English, that they could not participate successfully in economic and political

life--there would be grounds for fearing that the society could not bear the

strain of further immigration. But if the immigrants are, as all evidence

indicates, learning the national language, respecting the rules of political

participation, and proving victorious in the economic arena, then precisely

what threat do they pose? For better and for worse, America has always been an

open, fluid, commercial culture. It has embraced those willing to play the game

its way, and today's immigrants are as willing to do so as any of their

predecessors have been.<p>



<p>



<p>



What of the embedded, "ineradicable" cultural differences that today's

immigrants may introduce? To judge them we must leave the realm of evidence and

enter that of faith. Either you believe that American society, which has

absorbed and adjusted to so much, will be overpowered by this new challenge, or

you do not. My own, purely anecdotal impression, shaped by stories like those

of the Nguyens and their Mexican and Korean and Haitian counterparts, is that

American culture will prove resilient. "I certainly don't think the shift from

Poles and Slavs to Koreans and Vietnamese is all that significant," the

historian Stephan Thernstrom, of Harvard, told Barry Siegel, of the Los Angeles

Times, last December. "That's not to say there are no strains, but nothing now

portends what the country went through in the mid-nineteenth century and the

start of the twentieth century."<p>



<p>



<p>



We are left, then, with the nasty question of how much resistance to

immigration arises merely from color prejudice. Some of it undoubtedly does.

This is an atavistic emotion, part of American history and perhaps even of

human nature. But it is ugly and ignoble, and it deserves no reflection in

American law.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



At the bottom of all fear of strangers, especially those of a different color,

is the idea that they will remain a culture apart, separated by race and

behavior and aspirations from the surrounding society. The most sobering

impression left by my exposure to today's immigrants--not at all what I started

out looking for-- is the reminder that such a culture already exists, and it is

not made of those new to our shores.<p>



<p>



<p>



Immigrants rarely get their start in the middle-class enclaves and the

high-rent districts. When they move to a city, they settle in today's

equivalents of New York's Lower East Side. In most cities, that means that

Cubans and Vietnamese are moving into areas that for at least a generation have

been home to American blacks. There they do their best to establish themselves.

Predominantly black areas of Long Beach, for example, are becoming centers for

Cambodian and Vietnamese merchants, doctors, and dentists. From such proximity,

poisonous relations have grown.<p>



<p>



<p>



To many American blacks, it seems obvious that the immigrants, so new to the

country, have been more warmly treated than the blacks, who have been here all

along. Marvin Dunn, a black psychologist at Florida International University,

in Miami, says, "When the first wave of Cubans moved in, there was a deep

resentment at all the financial assistance and resettlement aid the government

was giving them, at the expense of social programs for people who had been

living here. Now there is resentment at a system that would prefer to hire

Haitians because they work more cheaply and complain less." Many blacks also

point out that the jobs as porters, maids, parking-lot attendants, and hotel

workers which their teenagers might otherwise hold are being filled by

immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



For their part, Dunn says, "The Haitians have a sense that we complain too

much, that our children are out of control, that we don't do enough for

ourselves." From Asian refugees, from Cubans, from black-skinned immigrants

from the Caribbean, I heard blunt, ungenerous assessments of the black

Americans among whom they lived. The contrast is probably sharpest in Miami,

where, compared with American blacks, one immigrant group, the Cubans, is

economically so successful, and another, the Haitians, seems better loved by

the Anglo and Cuban communities, despite its dark skin. The Haitians may live

four to a room in ramshackle boarding houses; they may have difficulty finding

work, except on the labor gangs in central Florida's vegetable-growing regions.

Still, they seem hopeful, determined, convinced that they can make a better

life for themselves. "These Haitian families are very hardworking, moonlighting

two or three jobs," said a white woman who coordinates Creole bilingual

education at a heavily Haitian school. "They have a lot of confidence in the

system, they have a lot of trust in the schools. Much more so than many

American blacks, who have lost faith in the system."<p>



<p>



<p>



The immigrants are on their way up, their children guaranteed a better life

simply because they will be raised in Los Angeles or Miami instead of Pnompenh

or Port-au-Prince. Their optimistic faith that hard work will be rewarded is

precisely what is lacking among the black teenagers and young mothers with whom

the immigrants share the inner-city streets.<p>



<p>



<p>



Such an absence of faith cannot be incomprehensible when legalized segregation

is but one generation in the past, when extralegal discrimination lives on, and

when official policies, especially those built into the welfare system, imply

that such people cannot really be expected to take responsibility for their

fates. Still, the fact remains that the culture of the black underclass leaves

its members worse equipped for economic advancement than immigrants who start

out with less.<p>



<p>



<p>



With some exceptions, such as the criminal minority among the Marielitos,

immigrants do not engage in crime and violence. Although fathers often leave

their wives and children behind when they migrate in search of work, they

typically send money home for support. When I asked young men from Mexico or

Haiti about the families they left behind, I usually got a detailed, up-to-date

report. Families that migrate together or form after migration are generally

stable. There is usually a father as well as a mother to provide an example to

the children and to discipline them. There are exceptions to all these

generalizations within the spectrum of immigrants, but most immigrants are

closer to the pattern the generalizations suggest than are most members of the

American black urban lower class.<p>



<p>



<p>



Many black officials and intellectuals who fear that immigration is harming the

black lower class recite the economic arguments about depressed wage rates and

competition for entry-level jobs. But when they spoke to me with greatest

passion, they were not talking about immigrants at all. Rather, they were

explaining that their deepest fears arise from the cleavage within black

society.<p>



<p>



<p>



"Some people seem to think that all blacks are poor and dispossessed," says

Marvin Dunn. "It's not true. There are two black Americas. One is doing very

well, better than ever. It is taking advantage of the system, moving up. The

other is getting larger as a group, and it is sinking deeper into the quagmire

of despair. That is the group that threatens the rest of America, black and

white."<p>



<p>



<p>



It becomes a self-perpetuating system," Dunn says. People who have grown up in

single-parent families, especially boys without fathers, are less likely to

have a sense of family responsibility when they grow up. The high volume of

children who are growing up outside a family network could ultimately cause the

destruction of the black family structure."<p>



<p>



<p>



"This is the black man's black problem," says T. Willard Fair, of the Miami

Urban League, an imposing, flamboyantly outspoken man with a shaved head. Fair

is a leading advocate of restricting immigration; he has allied himself with

Roger Conner's organization, FAIR. He argues that immigrants' gains have been

black Americans' losses, especially in Miami, where Cubans and Haitians have

made blacks politically and economically "dispensable" to whites. He has

recommended a one percent sales tax in Dade County to finance black

self-improvement. But, he says, though more money and fewer immigrants are

necessary conditions for black self-improvement, they will not be sufficient

unless the pathological culture of the black lower class is directly

confronted.<p>



<p>



<p>



"White America created that problem," Fair says, "but they are not in a

position to solve it. I am concerned that we are on the verge of losing a

generation of children. They have no ambition, no hope for a better future.

They live for the now. We have got to understand that unless we [blacks] as a

people put some basic values back in place, all the other stuff we talk

about--the high joblessness, the housing shortage--won't mean anything."<p>



<p>



<p>



Strictly speaking, the lower-class cultural problem is not directly connected

with immigration, except as the flow of willing foreign workers gives employers

even less incentive to find a place for black teenagers. But if our attitude

toward immigration ultimately turns on our notion of what makes a society

cohere, then it invites speculation about the other ingredients of cultural

cohesion. I, at least, have been left with the feeling that our major social

challenge will not be assimilating the Minhs and the Garzas, no matter how many

of them might come. Rather, it will be coming to terms with that part of

American society most estranged from the rest, giving its members a reason to

feel that they belong.<p>



<p>



THE LAW<p>



<p>



Twice in its history, the American government has undertaken a top-to-bottom

re-examination of its immigration laws. The first time, the process took more

than twenty years to complete. It began in 1907, with the appointment of the

Immigration Commission, chaired by Senator William Dillingham, of Vermont, and

continued through the late 1920s as successive "national origins" acts were

passed.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Dillingham Commission was able to write on a blank slate; when it began its

celebrations, there was virtually no immigration law to revise. But by the time

Congress approved the creation of a Select Commission on Immigration and

Refugee Policy, in 1978, the immigration code had grown until it was exceeded

in complexity and length only by the internal-revenue laws.<p>



<p>



<p>



The original chairman of the Select Commission was Reubin Askew, the former

governor of Florida. When he resigned, in 1979, to accept President Carter's

nomination as the U.S. trade representative, he was succeeded by Theodore

Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. The fifteen other members of the Select

Commission included four Cabinet members; four senators; four congressmen; and

a state supreme court judge, a labor leader, and an official of the Los Angeles

city government who were, respectively, of Mexican, Cuban, and Japanese

descent. In all, half of the Select Commission's members could trace their

lineage to the New Immigration. They included former Secretary of State Edmund

Muskie, former Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti, and former Representative

Elizabeth Holtzman. By contrast, all the members of the Dillingham Commission

were descendants of Englishmen or Scots.<p>



<p>



<p>



The Select Commission held public hearings in a dozen cities, from Albany to

Phoenix. Like the Dillingham Commission, it hired scholars and consultants for

studies of the economic, linguistic, demographic, and cultural implications of

continued immigration. In March of 1981, it released its final report and

recommendations; since then, these have focused the political deliberations

about controlling immigration.<p>



<p>



<p>



The legislative vehicle for the Select Commission's recommendations has been

the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, named for its two sponsors, Republican Senator Alan

K. Simpson, of Wyoming, who served on the Select Commission, and Democratic

Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, of Kentucky, who did not. The bill passed the

Senate last year, but a flurry of amendments kept it from coming to a vote in

the House. It died at the end of that congressional session, but was

reintroduced early this year. It has once again passed the Senate and is still

awaiting action in the House.<p>



<p>



<p>



The premise of the Select Commission's report and of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill

is that legal immigration is good for the United States but illegal immigration

is bad. Immigrants work hard, save and invest, and create more jobs than they

take," said Theodore Hesburgh, when presenting the Select Commission's findings

to a congressional committee in 1981. "The children of immigrants, according to

our studies, acculturate well to American life and actually seem to be

healthier and to do better in school on the average than those of native-born

Americans." Therefore, "it is in the national interest of the United States to

accept a reasonable number of immigrants and refugees each year. . . regardless

of the color, nationality, or religion of those admitted." But illegal

immigration creates a climate of lawlessness. Its victims, Hesburgh said,

include not only the working-class Americans whose wages are depressed but the

illegal immigrants themselves ("the ones who are victimized by unscrupulous

employers, those who die in the desert, or in the ballast tanks of ships") and

those would-be immigrants denied admission ("the ones who are waiting patiently

in line for so many years to come to the United States through the normal legal

immigration channels").<p>



<p>



<p>



Before this general principle can be applied to creating specific policies,

three questions must be answered. First, can the U.S. accept as many immigrants

as would like to come--that is, could it handle illegal immigration simply by

legalizing the entire flow? Second, if it must exclude some potential

immigrants, how can it most effectively do so? Third, how, then, should it

choose which immigrants to admit?<p>



<p>



<p>



There is almost no dissent on question number one. The population of the Third

World nations is expected to increase by 1.6 billion in the next twenty years;

more than 80 million additional people will enter the Latin American labor

force before the end of this century. Perhaps Mexico will discover a way to

feed and employ its rapidly growing population; but for the moment the flow of

Mexican emigrants is on the rise. As Central America's population soars, its

nations are disrupted by warfare and revolution.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



In the face of such pressures, the U.S. has no choice but to limit immigration.

The environmental consequences of a larger American population cannot be

conclusively proved. What can be proved is that successful absorption of

immigrants is largely a matter of proportion. The annual flow of legal

immigrants has ranged between 400,000 and 800,000 through the past decade. Even

those levels, so modest by comparison with the ones reached during the New

Immigration, have provoked widespread uneasiness and concern. The Select

Commission staff recommended that future net immigration be set at 750,000 a

year. But after the Cuban and Haitian landings of 1980, the commission decided

to recommend 500,000 a year, which was reflected in the original version of the

Simpson-Mazzoli bill.<p>



<p>



<p>



If the purpose of the bill is to open the door to legal immigration, this seems

inordinately timid. Immigrants had a shock effect in 1980 because so many of

them arrived unexpectedly in so few places. Regular, legal immigration is far

less disturbing. If illegal immigration were more effectively limited, an

increase in legal immigration might be tolerated; we would have less reason to

fear that the situation was out of control. Relative to our current population

size, total immigration of 800,000 a year would be one third the rate during

the New Immigration; one million would be less than half as much. If immigrants

add vigor to our economy and culture, can we not accommodate half as large an

alien presence as our grandfathers did?<p>



<p>



<p>



Still, as many as we choose to admit, more would desire to come. Somehow the

flow must be controlled, and there would be no shrinking from the realities

that implies. "Controlling immigration" means using the police and military

powers of the state to thwart the desires of human beings whose only fault is

having been born on the wrong side of a national border. There is no

alternative to exercising those powers, but they should be effective and

humane. Current practice is neither.<p>



<p>



<p>



The main burden is placed on the Border Patrol, supplemented by sporadic

campaigns by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to detect pockets of

illegal aliens in garment factories, restaurants, and other employment centers.

The tools at the government's disposal are hardly fearsome to most. Although it

is a crime to "enter without inspection," the punishment in most cases is

deportation. For an immigrant from Nigeria or Korea, this is a serious sanction

(and an expensive one for the U.S. government which pays the air fare back

home). For Mexicans apprehended at or near the border, it is not. For them,

deportation usually means a ride in a Border Patrol bus back to the river, and

another attempt the next day.<p>



<p>



<p>



Although illegal immigrants may be arrested if found in an American workplace,

the employer who hires them faces no penalty whatsoever. The immigration code

imposes a $2,000 fine or up to five years in jail on anyone who "conceals,

harbors, or shields from detection" an illegal alien, but thanks to a clause

known as the "Texas proviso," passed at growers' insistence in 1952, hiring an

illegal immigrant "shall not be deemed to constitute harboring."<p>



<p>



<p>



The Census Bureau estimates that 500,000 illegal aliens enter each year. That

does not mean that the alien population grows by 500,000 a year, because a

large but unknown number come temporarily as sojourners. Researchers from the

University of Texas have attempted to estimate the number of Mexicans here

illegally by seeing how many people (especially working-age males) disappeared

unaccountably from the Mexican population between one Mexican census and the

next. They determined that between 1.5 and 4.0 million Mexicans were illegally

in the U.S. in 1980, which is a smaller number than has been suggested by

"certain non-empirically based speculations on the subject."<p>



<p>



<p>



Since the illegal immigrants themselves cannot be directly counted, the

government pays attention to the things it can count--especially the number of

people the Border Patrol manages to stop on the way in. This figure has soared.

In 1965, the Border Patrol and the INS located about 110,000 "deportable

aliens," mainly through efforts at the border. (The Border Patrol attempts to

prevent illegal entry at the border; the INS supervises legal entry there and

is in charge of "area control" in cities away from the border.) By 1970, the

agencies found more than 320,000, and through the late 1970s they apprehended

roughly one million illegal aliens per year, more than 90 percent of them from

Mexico. After the peso devaluation of 1982, border stations reported another

sharp rise in the number of people apprehended. In the Border Patrol's El Paso

sector, for example, the number rose by 33 percent between August of 1981 and

August of 1982. Through the first eight months of 1983, apprehensions were well

above the 1982 levels.<p>



<p>



<p>



Such increases reflect the increased pressures driving people out of Mexico and

Central America. But the figures are also subject to bureaucratic distortions.

As Border Patrol officials are the first to point out, a woman crossing for the

day to work as a maid in El Paso looks just the same on the records as a young

man from Nicaragua nearing the end of his thousand-mile pilgrimage north. The

least significant immigrants--the thousands of day laborers who trudge across

the Rio Grande as dawn breaks each day--are the easiest to catch. In border

cities like El Paso, the Border Patrol can arrest virtually as many of these

casual crossers as it chooses. When political attention is focused on

apprehension figures, this is the way to build totals with less effort than is

required to break immigrant-smuggling operations or to "cut sign"--that is, to

track small bands of intruders through the mountains and desert.<p>



<p>



<p>



Border Patrol officials also point out that apprehension totals omit the

crucial return-migration figure. While visiting border stations in Texas and

California late last year, I was told that northward activity might be light.

The main flow would be to the south, back home for the holidays.<p>



<p>



<p>



But even when all the limits to statistical precision have been noted, Border

Patrol officials are unanimous in saying that more illegal immigrants are

attempting to come. The conventional political wisdom is that the Border Patrol

is doomed to impotence in controlling the flow. With 2,000 miles of unfortified

border to survey and a total work force of 2,600, no more than 450 of whom are

patrolling at one time, the Border Patrol is said to be hopelessly outmatched.

"There is not enough money in the federal budget to have the Border Patrol

stand arm in arm for 2,000 miles, which is what it would take," says Henry

Cisneros, of San Antonio.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



My own observations of border patrol activities left me moderately more

optimistic about the patrol's potential. Yes, the border is vast, and no, it

will never be sealed. When I asked Border Patrol and INS officials in El Paso

and San Diego whether a very patient immigrant could be absolutely certain of

penetrating, the answer was always yes. As I moved down the hierarchy, I heard

increasingly skeptical estimates of how much of the flow was being stopped. The

station chiefs and district directors said they thought that their men caught

one illegal immigrant in two or three. In the vans patrolling "the line," I

heard estimates of one in four to one in eight--and everyone was guessing. The

old hands said that new patrolmen had to get used to the idea that it was just

a job. You had to go out and serve your eight hours and do what you could. If

you thought about all the ones who got through, you would soon burn out.<p>

<p>



<p>



Nonetheless, it was also clear that the Border Patrol, however porous, made a

big difference by its mere presence, much as highway patrolmen affect the speed

of traffic even though they could never arrest everyone going over 55. Most of

the activity is concentrated in a few well-known areas. Although the E1 Paso

sector, second busiest after Chula Vista, south of San Diego, is responsible

for 341 miles of border, 86 percent of the illegal entrants it apprehends cross

in a ten-mile stretch around E1 Paso.<p>



<p>



<p>



This is not the same thing as saying that 86 percent of all crossings are made

in those ten miles, but it can hardly be surprising that immigration is

heaviest in urban areas. In the El Paso sector, where the border arbitrarily

divides one large urban population into the American city of El Paso and the

Mexican city of Juarez, a Mexican who makes it the first fifty yards in from

the border has the hardest part of his journey behind him. Once away from the

river, he can mingle in street scenes dominated by Mexican and Mexican-American

faces (300,000 of Juarez's one million residents have credentials to cross the

border legally every day). The Border Patrolmen pride themselves on being able

to pick out illegal immigrants by their dress and demeanor--everyone else will

look at a Border Patrol car as it drives by, they say, whereas an illegal

immigrant will suddenly stare at a lamp post--but the chances of blending in

are better here than in the desert.<p>



<p>



<p>



Perhaps because all sides realize that so many are getting through, there is a

routinized, almost casual air to the Border Patrol's dealings with immigrants

in El Paso. As I sat alongside the pilot in a Border Patrol helicopter, he

relentlessly tracked a limping Mexican man and two Mexican women carrying

string shopping bags, flushing them from a housing development where they

attempted to hide, pinning them in a cul-de-sac as a van roared through the

streets to apprehend them. The drama and terror of such a moment, or of the

nighttime chases on foot through back alleys, seemed lost on the patrolmen--and

on their quarry, as well. Each was doing his job; they would probably meet

again, in the same way. Five minutes after tracking down the three, the

helicopter pilot was chuckling as he buzzed a stocky Mexican man standing

knee-deep in the Rio Grande. "We call him the old capitalist," the pilot said

of the man, who had his trousers rolled up and was carrying others across the

river piggyback. "He keeps regular hours, goes on vacation with his wife. As

long as he stays in the river, we can't touch him."<p>



<p>



There are higher stakes for both sides in Chula Vista, the busiest part of the

border. Fewer of the immigrants are day-crossers. This is the northern terminus

of a long migration path up the Mexican interior; a hundred miles farther north

lie the incalculable opportunities of Los Angeles. In the Border Patrol's

favor, the "line" does not split a city here. For at least a mile north of the

border, open fields constitute a no-man's land. From a hilltop with a view of

the border, patrolmen spend nights peering through infrared scopes, looking for

the bright-green patterns that are would-be immigrants huddling in a riverbed

or crawling through the grass. The scopes, originally designed for Army tanks,

are probably more effective for the Border Patrol, since its targets can do so

little to conceal themselves or to disrupt the Patrol's activities.<p>



<p>



<p>



Almost a thousand people a day are apprehended in this sector; in the course of

several hours on the hilltop, I watched patrolmen pick out a group of crawling

or running green shapes every few minutes and then, by radio, guide patrolmen

on horseback to intercept them. Unlike E1 Paso's sojourners, many of these

people tried to escape. They seemed desperate at having been caught. It was an

ugly and sobering business; this is what the abstraction of "controlling the

border" really means. But it also suggested that the Border Patrol can be more

than a fig leaf. The crucial variable, as with the police, seems to be

presence, and more presence requires more money. The least controversial part

of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill is its recommendation that the Border Patrol be

beefed up.<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



While a stronger border patrol might further restrict illegal immigration, it

will not stop it. All parties to the political debate agree that poor people

will continue to come to a rich country until life in their homeland

improves.<p>



<p>



<p>



Some claim that if international poverty is the ultimate cause of immigration,

coping with poverty is the cure. Thus Senator Gary Hart, of Colorado, has said

that immigration policy is really foreign policy. By encouraging economic

development, we can reduce the pressures that drive people to our shores.

Logically and ethically appealing as this approach may be, it is also utterly

unrealistic, at least as the centerpiece of immigration policy. Through all its

decades of providing foreign aid, the U.S. has helped other nations grow more

wheat and produce more steel, but it has been spectacularly unsuccessful in

sponsoring large job-creation projects in the Third World.<p>



<p>



<p>



As its answer to illegal immigration, the Select Commission recommended the

step that has become the most hotly contended feature of the Simpson-Mazzoli

bill: "employer sanctions," which would undo the Texas proviso--that is, make

it a crime to hire illegal immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



The case in favor of employer sanctions is that jobs are the magnet for illegal

immigrants, and if the jobs disappear, so will the incentive to migrate.

Technical arguments rage about the circumstances in which limited

employer-sanction programs have or have not proven effective in Europe or in

certain American states. But there is a commonsense connection between

restricting jobs and restricting illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants told

me that the one place they had to produce plausible documents in order to be

hired was southern Florida. (Elsewhere, employers asked at most for Social

Security numbers and immigrants provided fake documents, a ruse expedient for

both sides. ) Miami was also the only place where I saw illegal immigrants who

had trouble finding work.<p>



 <p>



<p>



"The chief attraction of employer sanctions for me is that it controls jobs

rather than people," the economist Michael Piore told a congressional committee

in 1981. "I think it is more humane in general....Most undocumented immigrants

come to work....If you could eliminate work opportunities, you would therefore

stop the basic attraction. People do develop attachments to this

country....Once those attachments develop, it becomes extremely cruel and, I

think, in a fundamental sense, inhuman, to expel them."<p>



<p>



<p>



Under the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, those entitled to work legally in the United

States would have to carry some sort of identification. The bill leaves the

details of the identification system vague and asks the President to report on

different options within three years.<p>



<p>



<p>



Three groups have formed an unlikely alliance to oppose this plan. Together,

they were responsible for keeping the Simpson-Mazzoli bill from coming to a

vote in the House last year. Business interests, including agricultural

growers, claim that checking credentials will be yet another intolerable

regulatory burden. Their real objection, especially in the case of the growers,

seems to be the loss of a hardworking part of the labor force. In deference to

growers' interests, the Simpson-Mazzoli bill includes a plan under which

foreign laborers can be temporarily imported, usually for farm work.<p>



<p>



<p>



Civil libertarians, including the American Civil Liberties Union, view the

national identity card as another dangerous infringement on individual rights

and privacy. "A secure verification system could very likely be built on a

national data bank which would centralize personal data about all persons

authorized to work in the United States," John Shattuck, of the ACLU, told a

congressional committee last year.<p>



<p>



<p>



To such assertions, Senator Simpson has replied that the national identity card

would be nothing more than a forge-proof record of a Social Security number,

which is already required when accepting most jobs, opening a bank account,

registering at many universities, and participating in other aspects of modern

life. How would civil liberties be harmed, he asks, by a more authentic card?

Are they not more gravely threatened by continuing to encourage the flow of

immigrants who live outside the full protection of the law?<p>



<p>



<p>



Finally, Hispanic organizations oppose employer sanctions, arguing that a

crackdown on illegal immigrants will become a crackdown on anyone who looks

Hispanic. "Well meaning employers, fearful of government sanctions, will shy

away from hiring us," says Vilma Martinez, of the Mexican American Legal

Defense and Educational Fund. "Racist or biased employers will simply use the

fear sanctions as an excuse to avoid hiring us."<p>



<p>



<p>



The supporters of the bill contend that, on the contrary, a universal identity

card will protect Hispanic Americans. Since everyone will have to present his

identity card, Flanigan as well as Rodriguez, the Hispanic will have ironclad

proof of his right to hold the job. (Under the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, the

employer would be obliged to ask for the card, and once it was presented, he

would be obliged to accept it as proof of legally admitted status.) This has

not convinced the Hispanic organizations, who represent the most formidable

opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. Their arguments so persuaded Senator

Edward Kennedy, of Massachusetts, that he became the only member of the Senate

Judiciary Committee to vote against the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. The way out of

this standoff may be through modifications of the bill, such as those proposed

by Gary Hart. He has sponsored an amendment that would impose stiff penalties

on employers who discriminate against employees on the basis of "national

origin."<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



<p>



As a complement to its crackdown on illegal immigration, the Simpson-Mazzoli

bill proposes an amnesty for illegal aliens who are already here. Anyone who

could prove that he had been in the country since before a certain cutoff date

would be granted the status of having been legally admitted. Under the current

Senate version of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, anyone here before January 1, 1977,

would immediately qualify for permanent-resident status, and anyone here before

January 1, 1980, would qualify for temporary-resident status, which could be

converted to permanent-resident status if the immigrant demonstrated competence

in English within two years. The bill has not yet passed the House, and the

House version includes amendments that would push the 1977 date forward to

1982.<p>



<p>



<p>



We're never going to see again in this country what we saw in 1954 with

Operation Wetback," says Alan Eliason, the Border Patrol chief in E1 Paso,

speaking of the last large-scale attempt to round up illegal immigrants. "We

are not going to go out and try to locate and deport several million illegal

aliens. We don't have the resources. People won't stand for it. It's not going

to happen." Senator Simpson also says that amnesty is inseparable from the

basic goal of immigration reform: ending the two-class society in which some

immigrants live outside the shelter of the law.<p>



<p>



<p>



The major opposition to amnesty now comes from local governments. Once

immigrants are free to step out of the shadows, it is argued, they will demand

more public assistance. But if Orange County, California, or Dade County,

Florida, or Bexar County, Texas, ends up bearing an unfair burden for this

change in national policy, the federal government should offer reimbursement.

It is no solution at all to pretend that the U.S. will ever evict the millions

of legal immigrants who have already arrived.<p>



<p>



<p>



That leaves the final question about immigration policy: Of the many who hope

to come, how shall the U.S. choose which to accept? Admissions fall into two

categories--normal immigrants and refugees--and each presents painful

choices.<p>



<p>



<p>



In addition to changing the ethnic mix among immigrants, the reforms of 1965

placed a higher value on family reunification. Before, under the

McCarran-Walter Act of 1952, skilled workers had an advantage in qualifying for

admission. Since 1965, potential immigrants have been considered in three

tiers. First come the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, defined as spouses,

children under twenty-one, or parents of citizens over twenty-one, who are

admitted without limit.<p>



<p>



<p>



Next come less immediate relatives, who have first claim within the annual

ceilings of 20,000 immigrants per country and 270,000 from the entire world.

Places within these "numerically limited" categories are assigned according to

six preference categories, four of which are for relatives. First preference is

for unmarried adult children of U.S. citizens; second for spouses and unmarried

children of permanent-resident aliens; fourth for married children of U.S.

citizens; and fifth for brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens. Together,

these members of the extended family accounted for 190,000 of the numerically

limited admissions in 1978.<p>



<p>



<p>



Finally, there are immigrants without family ties to the United States, who, as

a whole, have far bleaker chances of admission. Some qualify for third

preference, professionals and people of "exceptional ability in the sciences or

the arts"; otherwise they are relegated to sixth preference, workers in

occupations with labor shortages, or to "non-preference," which is everyone

else. In 1978, some 14,000 occupational-preference immigrants were admitted,

along with their spouses and children, 16,000 in number. Only 54,000 people

were admitted as non-preference immigrants or through "private bills," special

legislation admitting immigrants one by one.<p>



<p>



<p>



A sane immigration policy would continue the emphasis on reuniting immediate

families. It is harder to see the justification for devoting so much of the

limited quotas to members of the extended family. Admissions systems are

inevitably arbitrary, but this is more so than most. It bestows benefits on

certain families simply because an uncle or a cousin managed to immigrate in

the past. It closes the door on the classic immigrant, the independent man or

woman who sets out to make a new life. As of 1980, Mexico had a backlog of

173,000 non-preference visa applications; worldwide, 280,000 non-preference

applications were pending. They will be considered only after the 807,000

preference-category applications are handled--which is to say, never. In

recognition of this imbalance, and in an attempt to open the door to new "seed

immigrants," the Select Commission proposed reducing the quotas for the

extended family and increasing them for independent immigrants. Why not follow

the logic to its conclusion? Keep the places for immediate family members, and

open the rest of the queue to independent immigrants.<p>



<p>



<p>



Refugees and applicants for political asylum present the most painful choices

of all. The 1965 Immigration Act reserved 6 percent, or 17,400 per year, of the

numerically limited visas for refugees. Under the Refugee Act of 1980, the

annual limit was raised to 50,000. But that law also gave the President

enormous leeway in admitting refugees, and in fiscal years 1980 and 1981

President Carter determined that more than 200,000 refugees should be accepted,

specifying a ceiling of 168,000 each year from Indochina and 33,000 from the

Soviet Union.<p>



<p>



<p>



If the major enforcement problem for the INS is stopping Mexican immigrants at

the border, its major administrative problem is handling the claims for refugee

status and political asylum filed by Haitians and Salvadorans. Almost none of

the claims have been approved; fewer than one hundred Salvadorans, for example,

have been granted asylum.<p>



<p>



<p>



One technical obstacle to the Haitian and Salvadoran claims is that the Refugee

Act of 1980 applies only to those who have already fled their homeland for some

country of first asylum other than the United States. "Vietnamese in Thailand

is eligible, but a Haitian who lands in Miami is not. He may apply for

political asylum, but he must prove, like candidates for refugee status, that

he is "unable or unwilling" to go home "because of persecution or a

well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,

membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." In principle,

this might be read to include almost anyone subject to the generalized

oppression of Third World governments. In practice, it covers almost anyone who

wants to leave the Soviet Union or its satellites, including Cuba, and precious

few others besides the Indochinese.<p>



<p>



<p>



The stories told by Haitian and Salvadoran "refugees" lack the crisp

distinctions implied by the law. A few give convincing testimony that specific

revenge awaits them if they go home. A larger number say that life there would

be worse than it is in the United States. They are, of course, correct; and

that is the ugly reality of our refugee policy. Most of the world's population

lives under some kind of repression. Even though America's upraised torch of

liberty is the noblest part of its role in the world, the U.S. cannot provide a

new home for all of the oppressed. To whom, then, should it offer shelter?<p>



<p>



<p>



The policy would seem less arbitrary if it were more narrowly focused. The

United States should accept as refugees those who have been political prisoners

or have been singled out for persecution. In addition, we have a special

responsibility in situations like Vietnam's, in which our policies have

directly affected foreigners' lives. (Some who advocate asylum for Salvadorans

say that the same reasoning should apply there, because of past and present

U.S. influence in that country.) For the rest, the U.S. should make more room

in its overall immigration quotas, offering a less arbitrary chance to the

millions around the world who hope for a better life and who could, in

unexpected ways, make our lives better too.<p>

<font size=6>A</font>RE cosmologists right to worry that 90 percent of the
	matter their
theories say should exist in the universe cannot be found? Is it
possible, as some measurements imply, that the universe as a whole is younger
than some of its component parts? Is there in fact only one universe, or does
there exist a variegated "multiverse"? What about "wormholes" -- those theorized
modes of time travel? If they're for real, then why hasn't the future already
come back to haunt us? (Or has it?)<p>
The discomfiting unanswered questions of recent years continue: Can it truly be
possible that there are "damp patches" on the sun, as the latest data
indicate -- and should this affect whether we blame the heat or the humidity? Is
global warming yet a palpable phenomenon? If so, is it due mostly to fossil
fuels or, as provocative studies suggest, to the methane produced by termites
and cattle? Did language develop in human beings in a single location, such as
Africa, and then diffuse outward, or did it develop in several places
independently, such as the Great Rift valley, the Anatolian plateau, and
Brooklyn?<p>

Science was not like this when I was young. As a practical matter, the world
still seemed mostly Newtonian (in some ways even Ptolemaic), and although

Einstein's theory of relativity could be a little
daunting, at least it turned
out to have a number of everyday applications (the atomic bomb, <i>The Twilight
Zone</i>). Today every important new development in science causes the ground
to shift, making ordinary people want to hold on to something solid, if there
is any such thing left. The earth's core used to be something you could count
on; but seismologists now say that the core is rotating separately from and
faster than the rest of the planet. Meanwhile, scientists at the National
Institute of Standards and Technology have announced the results of new
experiments demonstrating that it is indeed possible for an atom to be in two
different places at the same time.<p>

My own informal survey suggests that scientific studies nowadays are barred
from publication in reputable journals unless the peer-review
committee is satisfied that press reports about them will have to include the
phrase "calls into question long-accepted
theories about . . ." Exceptions are made only in the case of findings that
bolster the most disturbing and outlandish claims of quantum mechanics, when
the press may depict scientists as "breathing a huge sigh of relief."<p>

In this uncertain world I cling to the work of Marilyn vos Savant, the author
of the "Ask Marilyn" feature in <i>Parade </i>magazine. Vos Savant, who is
described in the small print at the end of every column as being "listed in the
'Guinness Book of World Records'<i> </i>Hall of Fame for 'Highest IQ,'" answers
questions from readers every week about science, mathematics, and diverse
aspects of the human condition. <i>What do you consider the most practical
invention of all time? </i>"Writing." <i>Please define time without speaking of
the measure of it by man. </i>"Time is the distance between the beginning of a
state and the end of it." <i>What is 'bad luck'? </i>"What we call 'bad luck'.
. . may indeed be unpredictable and without purpose, but we probably have more
control over it than we realize." <i>Why can't wind be seen? </i>"Wind is
merely air in motion,
and air is a mixture of gases whose particles are so small that they cannot be
seen by the unaided eye." With a confidence and a clarity that may transcend
the confining thrall of strict accuracy, Vos Savant considers the world as it
can be apprehended by our limited ken. Her aim is to establish tenuous
beachheads of certainty on the formidable Tarawa of the unknown.<p>

She is not alone. However mystified scientists may remain about all the most
significant questions, scores if not hundreds of researchers bent on exploring
the familiar have in recent years managed to tie up many loose ends. In
recognition of the work of Marilyn vos Savant and others, I propose the
creation of an award celebrating the distinguished exegesis of the mundane -- to
be known, perhaps, as the Savant. And I have a few suggestions for an inaugural
group of recipients.<p>

<CENTER>
<font size=6><B>. . .</B></font><p>
</CENTER>
<p>

A first Savant, in a field perhaps to be called psychodietetics, might go to
Professor Susan Basow and her student Diane Kobrynowicz, of Lafayette College,
in Easton, Pennsylvania. Basow and Kobrynowicz set out to test whether, as the
unverified claims of folk wisdom would have it, women who eat sparingly are
deemed more attractive than women who eat with Rabelaisian disregard. In a
controlled experiment a student actress from a nearby college was filmed eating
four different lunches, ranging from light to heavy; four groups of male and
female volunteers were each shown one of the four films and asked to evaluate
the lunch eater on various criteria of femininity and social appeal. The most
modest lunch consumed was "a small tossed salad with diet Italian dressing and
a glass of seltzer." The most substantial lunch was "a large meatball parmesan
sandwich . . . accompanied by six mozzarella sticks, large fries, a large soda,
and chocolate cake." The Basow and Kobrynowicz study found that the student
actress was deemed considerably more appealing by the volunteers who watched
her eating the smallest lunch than by the ones who watched her eating the
largest. This specific issue, most of us would concede, can now be regarded as
settled.<p>

The relationship of the memory of smell to social attitudes and social
development -- a field that might well be known as rhinomnemonology -- is
finally
getting the attention it deserves, owing in large measure to the Savant-worthy
investigations of Alan R. Hirsch, M.D., of the Chicago-based Smell and Taste
Treatment and Research Foundation. Some of his results fall into the realm of
suggestive generality: Hirsch has found, for instance, that among those born
from 1900 to 1929 childhood is associated with the smells of pine, hay, and sea
air, whereas among those born from 1930 to 1979 it is more likely to be
associated with the smells of VapoRub, scented markers, and Play-Doh. The
research for which Hirsch would receive an award is considerably more focused:
he has determined that people in whose memories of childhood the smells of body
odor, dog waste, sewer gas, and bus fumes dominate all others are more likely
to have been unhappy while growing up than those in whose memories of childhood
such smells are largely absent. Hirsch's findings in this regard will, I think,
be broadly accepted without cavil.<p>

Sabermetrics is the study of baseball statistics. A third Savant might be
awarded to practitioners in an important subfield -- what could be called
itinerosabermetrics. When organized baseball got under way, in the nineteenth
century, professional teams ventured to games far from home by train -- a means
of conveyance that was leisurely enough to minimize the biological effects of
travel across long distances. Has air travel affected team performance? This is
a question that many fans have asked -- and one that was addressed by
Lawrence D.
Recht, Robert A. Lew, and William J. Schwartz, a team of Massachusetts doctors
who studied American and National League scoring and travel records for the
1991 through 1993 seasons and recently published their findings in the journal
<i>Nature</i>. The reality of "performance decrements" caused by jet lag seems
undeniable: the doctors discovered that a home team could expect to score 1.24
more runs than usual when playing a visiting team that had just made an
eastward trip (the direction requiring the greatest readjustment) across three
time zones. What this means, medical science thus now shows, is that in game
two of the 1990 World Series, which took place in Cincinnati, the Oakland As,
rather than losing 5 to 4, actually beat the Reds 4 to 3.76. The series, which
was once thought to have been won by the Reds in a stunning four-game sweep,
therefore now stands unresolved at 3-1. Needless to say, the task of
statistically reconfiguring baseball history according to itinerosabermetic
principles will be immense. <p>

Armchair meteorologists like me have long wondered about the origin of violent
weather events -- vortigenetics? -- and in particular the propensity of weather
disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes to wipe out trailer parks. Some have
speculated that trailer parks might attract bad weather the way golf clubs
attract lightning (Callowaykinesis). The very question would no doubt be
dismissed as unscientific in the mainstream meteorological community, but this
did not put off the vortigeneticist Frank Wu, of the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, on whom a fourth Savant should be conferred. Comparing state-by-
state-data on mobile-home sales and number of tornadoes and hurricanes per
square
mile, Wu assembled a mass of compelling circumstantial evidence, which he
presented in <i>The Annals of Improbable Research</i>.<p>
<blockquote>Tornadoes and hurricanes are indeed most frequent in states
with many mobile
homes. For instance, eight states are in the top eleven for both prefab homes
and tornadoes. Furthermore, Florida leads the nation in violent storms and is
third in manufactured home purchases. Indiana ranks second in tornadoes and
first in mobile homes.</blockquote>
An open-minded
reader can draw but one conclusion.<p>

I look forward to extensions of established studies and, upon recommendation by
the Savant awards' executive committee, to formal recognition of new ones. The
eating-and-social-appeal
findings cited above, for example, cry out for follow-up. Surely the same
dynamic will turn out to diminish the attractiveness of males, endowing
Basow/Kobrynowicz's Law with the enviable status of a universal. Frank Wu is
already postulating a possible correlation between tornadoes and the presence
of video camcorders, which would certainly help to explain why, judging from
the impression left by television news, tornadoes always seem to put down
within sight of a video-equipped family in a station wagon ("as if, perhaps,"
Wu has suggested, "tornadoes were 'posing' for pictures").<p>

A study conducted in kindergarten classes in Philadelphia shows promise. Funded
by the Children's Literacy Initiative, the study has attempted to test
alternative ways of preparing children for reading instruction. One group of
kindergarten classes  -- the control group -- was selected to be given no
books, and
their teachers no special training pertinent to the teaching of reading. A
second group was selected to receive just books. A third group was selected to
receive copious supplies of books and lots of special teacher training. "At the
end of the school year," an account of the study explained, the groups "will be
surveyed to see if the books and training made a difference." Another
beachhead, it seems certain, is about to be secured.<p>

The field of panetics, which is the science of suffering, has been making quiet
inroads in academe since the creation of the International Society for Panetics
was reported in these pages some years ago. A recent issue of the society's
journal<i> </i>carries a call for an investigation into the nature and uses of
hypochondria which, if pursued, is almost certain to garner a Savant
nomination. The poet and paneticist Nora M. Barraford frames the issue as
follows:<p>
<blockquote>
"But everyone knows," most insurance companies may protest, "that
hypochondriacs aren't really sick at all. . . . That it is a 'known fact' they
are so much healthier than everyone around them [that] they usually outlive
their long suffering families and impatient, attendant doctors."<p>

Ever wondered why? Maybe we should check out their life styles and learn how to
be so much healthier than other people!</blockquote>
As for the design of the Savant award itself, I leave the matter to others.
Gold? Silver? Polished wood? The physical object could take any number of
forms. And in a larger sense, of course, this is one question that hardly needs
answering. Whatever material is chosen, it will be made, like the
aforementioned wind, out of particles too small to be seen with the unaided
eye -- and will thus be invisible anyway.

quest=About a month ago on the TV show 20/20 there was a segment
on a new surgical procedure for people with an enlarged heart.
It involved removing up to 1/3 of the heart and was being used
by a surgeon in South America I believe.  My brother in law
suffers from an enlarged heart and is in need of a transplant. 
He would like more information on this procedure as a possible 
alternative to a transplant.  I've been searching the Web for some 
information about this but can't seem to find anything.

<b>I am the mother of a 26-year-old man who was born with transposition of 
the great vessel.  When he was three years old, he had the Mustard 
procedure and did very well until about a year ago.  It was then we were 
told that because of the Mustard procedure not being the definitive 
surgery for this defect (but all that was available at that time), his 
heart is now failing and he will need a transplant.  His heart had begun 
to beat irregularly and a cardioversion was done two months ago.  It 
helped a lot.  He was able to function normally and was able to do 
physical things without getting out of breath.  He was feeling good.  It 
was felt that if his heart could maintain the regular heartbeat, the 
failure would slow down and the transplant could be put off, hopefully, 
for a few years.  He was put on the inactive transplant list.  This week, 
his heart went back into the irregular heartbeat and he was cardioverted 
again, this time with medication to keep his heart beating regularly.  
However, the medication has side effects which might make him a poor 
transplant candidate.  Would anyone know of any procedures that are being 
done to help patients who have had the Mustard procedure?  I know 
transplant is inevitable, but the longer he can wait, perhaps more 
advances will be made in the area of transplant and survival.  I know 
this is a web site for physicians, but if anyone could help me, I would 
appreciate it very much.</b>

<b>Dear Dr. Furman

I want to ask some questions regarding the radiofrequency catheter ablation
of ventricular tachycardia following implantation of an ICD.

1) Although most frequent or incessant ventricular tachycardia episodes
occur within the first days after implantation of an ICD, some patients
developed frequent or even incessant ventricular tachycardias during
long-term follow-up. What is the incidence of incessant and drug-refractory
VT in your experience ?.

2) What is your opinion about the reason for this phenomenon ? 
( proarrhythmic drug effects, acute ischemia, electrolyte imbalance,
modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate as a result of progression of
the underlying disease ).

Thank you in advance and best regards.

Losing hair and Rogaine
</title>
<h3>
Losing hair and Rogaine
</h3>
<br>
Dear Alice,
<p>
      I am a new graduate student who is very physically attractive--at 
      least for a little while longer. What I mean is that I have 
      started to lose my hair. I don't think that it's noticeable to 
      other people, but I have started to see 10-15 hairs on my pillow 
      every morning when I wake up. Also, when I run my hand through my 
      hair, a few more come right out.
<p>
I'm pretty much a realist (I don't think I'm being paranoid), but 
      this is one of the most frightening things that has happened to 
      me. In the "singles world," even the suspicion that someone is 
      losing his hair is enough to make another person look the other 
      way---especially in the "gay" scene. I know, because I've done it 
      myself, as have many of my friends. I certainly look for other 
      qualities besides physical attractiveness, but of course that part 
      is important, too, and a receding hairline or thinning hair is 
      just not generally attractive. In any case, I'm wrecked. I'm 
      wondering what the best ways, if any, are to deal with this 
      problem. I've heard of Rogaine and know it's expensive---but how 
      expensive? And how effective? Where do I go for some sort of 
      consultation?
<br>     Signed,
<br>     Scared and Thinning


<hr>
<br>
Dear Scared and Thinning-
<p>
First of all, you should know that each person should expect to 
      lose between 100-200 strands of hair a day. This is because hair 
      grows in cycles that last from two to seven years. Each individual 
      strand has its own seven year cycle, until it falls out as a 
      normal part of brushing or washing your hair. For moderate hair 
      loss, you can try to improve your diet by adding more complete 
      protein and some supplements such as zinc (30 to 40 mg daily), 
      Vitamin B complex, Vitamin C (2,000 to 3,000 mg daily), sulfur and 
      iron. Wheat germ is considered to be an excellent supplement for 
      hair loss. If you feel like your hair is coming out in handfuls, 
      you should contact a doctor, who will probably want to do a 
      complete workup, to see if there is a link to any other medical 
      problem. Hair loss can also be stress-related, or tied to an 
      emotional problem. 
<p>
Rogaine, a product used to stimulate hair growth, has been shown 
      to produce minimal to moderate growth of hair in 33% of the people 
      using it as directed. (Results of a study done by the company that 
      makes the product, Upjohn.) It was also shown that a placebo hair-
      growth drug, which had no active ingredient, produced minimal to 
      moderate growth of hair in 20% of its users. Mind over matter? The 
      current cost for Rogaine according to a local pharmacy, is $55.95 
      for a 2 ounce spray bottle, estimated to last approximately one 
      month. (This varies of course, depending on how much you spray 
      daily.) You can ask about a prescription for Rogaine from a 
      provider at Health Services ( 4-2284 for an appointment). In 
      thinking about starting Rogaine, remember that it is a lifelong 
      commitment. You need to use the drug regularly and consistently to 
      produce results. This is a big investment and commitment to make, 
      and your provider will probably want to discuss this with you 
      before prescribing the hair-stimulating product.

Sudden hair growth?
</title>
<h3>
Sudden hair growth?
</h3>
<br>
Help! My body hair has suddenly gotten out of control!
<p>
I am a 23 year old Columbia student with a "general health" 
      problem which is a bit unique -- my worries may seem even seem 
      vain. Nevertheless, I have been searching for the answer to my 
      problem for the past year to no avail. Perhaps your wisdom can 
      help out. My problem is with my body hair. In the past year, my 
      body hair has proliferated and darkened in places I have never had 
      hair, or in places where I could barely see my hair. I am an Asian 
      woman, and as you may know, Asians typically have a very small 
      amount of body hair. I have always been typically sparse of body 
      hair, and have loved its convenience. Of course, I have always had 
      a healthy amount of hair on my head, underarms, and pubic area. I 
      have always had a minuscule amount of hair on the rest of my body. 
      I never shaved my legs, toes, stomach -- until now... 
<p>
In this past year (not any earlier!) the hair on my arms and legs 
      has darkened and multiplied so much so that I have had to (gasp!) 
      shave my legs. Also, I now have hair growing on my breasts!!!!!) 
      my chin (!!), my toes etc.  I know it is perfectly natural for 
      most people to have a fair amount of hair in these areas. However, 
      I have never had hair in these areas until very recently. And yes, 
      I am mortified at the hair on my breasts and my chin!
<p>
Since I am well past puberty, I do not know why my body decided to 
      have an unsightly hair growth spurt. I must note that I have a lot 
      of eczema, for which I have taken lots and lots of hydrocortisone 
      in the years. I know hydrocortisone is a mild steroid, and I know 
      the steroids that athletes have been known to take often creates 
      hair growth -- but I have NEVER read in medical literature that 
      hydrocortisone use = abnormal hair growth. I also take the 
      medication Tegretol, to control my epilepsy. I have read up on 
      Tegretol, and I have never read anything about hair growth. Oh, I
      also am on the Pill.
<p>
I guess I do not know what causes hair growth in the first place 
      (what hormone, chemicals, etc.) -- but I would love your help in 
      this mystery. Thanks in advance --
<p>
Freaky Follicles


<hr>
<br>
Dear Freaky Follicles-
<p>
It is definitely unusual to have sudden hair growth and it may 
      signal an endocrine imbalance. You should make an appointment at 
      Women's Health to speak with a provider about this occurrence (4-
      2284) or just walk-in to the fourth floor John Jay. The other 
      possible culprit could be your birth control pills. Certain types 
      of pills can be associated with hair growth. Pills that have a 
      high estrogen content may be more likely to cause hair growth in 
      women. If the start of the hair growth has coincided with your 
      taking the pill, you should speak to a provider, also at Women's 
      Health, about changing to a lower dosage pill. Low-dose combined 
      birth control pills (having both estrogen and progesterone) tend 
      to suppress a woman's production of testosterone, a male hormone, 
      which is related to hair growth. The newest progestin-only pills 
      can actually be beneficial in treating excessive hair growth. 
      Again, this is something that should definitely be discussed with 
      a provider. See the person who prescribed the pills originally, or 
      any other provider you feel comfortable with. But this sudden 
      growth of hair is definitely unusual and important to check out 
      soon.

Asthma and steroids
</title>
<h3>
Asthma and steroids
</h3>
<br>
Dear Alice:
<p>
I am a 32 year old woman dating a very nice man my age. I have 
      never seen this problem come up before and would appreciate your 
      advice. My boyfriend and I have been dating for just about over a 
      year and we are serious about each other. He has severe asthma and 
      has to be on high doses of steroids during and for a long time 
      after a flare-up. The problem is these steroids have a terrible 
      effect on him: he breaks out in acne; he is irritable and loses 
      control of his temper; his appetite is voracious; he puffs out in 
      his stomach and face. 
<p>
The problem with his temper and irritability is what most bothers 
      me, it is as if he has a completely different personality and 
      sometimes it is frightening. Both he and I have talked to his 
      doctor who says that these steroids are the drug of choice in my 
      boyfriend's illness, and if he does not take them as an 
      outpatient, he would have to be hospitalized, on the same 
      medications.
<p>
As I said, his personality can be frightening on the steroids, but 
      I have seen my boyfriend in an asthma attack which is even more 
      frightening. I once talked to a therapist about this problem. 
      Maybe I should have been more careful in choosing a therapist, but 
      this woman came from a feminist perspective and in a sense told me 
      that I should break up with this man; women don't have to tolerate 
      being treated in this manner. I don't think that this is the 
      solution since I love him very much and I know the real man off of 
      steroids and this is the man I love. Any suggestions with this 
      problem would be appreciated. --Sign me, Love him drug free

Dear Love him drug free, 
<p>
Alice is going to assume on advice from a doctor that your 
      boyfriend is taking the steroids orally, rather than through an 
      inhaler. Steroids taken orally tend to produce all the side 
      effects you describe. Currently, the treatment of choice for 
      severe asthma such as your boyfriend's is a steroid inhaler. There 
      are much fewer side effects with the inhaler as the steroids are 
      working directly where they need to-- the respiratory tract-- and 
      are not entering one's system. 
<p>
Alice suggests that your boyfriend go to another doctor for a 
      second opinion, and particularly for him to ask about the steroid 
      inhalers for his condition. You can help him by being an advocate 
      within the medical system-- finding another doctor, going with him 
      if he wants, asking questions, etc. You are also right in knowing 
      that his personality changes are related to the drugs-- 
      irritability, anxiety, aggressiveness, etc. are all side effects 
      of steroids. This is not a job for a therapist-- it is a job for 
      an M.D.

How often to wash hair?

How often to wash hair?
</h3>
<br>
Alice, The last time I was at the hair cutting 
      salon, the person who washed my hair asked me if I washed my hair 
      everyday. I said I did, and she said she could tell. I'm not sure 
      what she meant by this, but please tell me how she could determine 
      this, and what is the best overall practice for washing hair in 
      terms of frequency. I'm interested in the health of my hair as 
      well as the health of my scalp.
<p>Thanks for you help. --Allison.

Dear Allison,

<p>Proper hair and scalp care involves washing your hair regularly to 
      remove the normal buildup of dirt, dead skin cells, oils produced 
      by skin glands, and any other substances you put in your hair such 
      as hair spray, etc. The frequency with which you wash your hair 
      depends on the condition of your hair. Basic guidelines are to 
      wash your hair a few times a week for dry hair, and every day or 
      every other day for oily hair. 

<p>If you do choose to wash your hair daily, make sure that you are 
      using a pH-balanced shampoo and only wash it once. If you wash it 
      more than once a day, you will be removing too much of the natural 
      oil found in hair. Of the shampoos available on the market, most 
      contain water, foaming agents, fragrances (often added to mask 
      odors of other ingredients), and various amounts of detergents. 
      Shampoos that are designed for oily hair have more detergent than 
      shampoos for nonoily hair. Detergents can make hair less 
      manageable and cause it to lose body. Shampoos with more 
      detergents may also come with "conditioners" which remain on hair 
      even after rinsing, to prevent hair from being completely stripped 
      of oils. 

<p>Here are some guidelines for choosing a shampoo for your 
      particular type of hair:

<ul>
<li>Damaged or fine hair: Use protein shampoo labeled substantive 
      protein. Shampoo should be more than mildly acidic. Or you can 
      rinse your hair following shampoo with white vinegar and water, or 
      lemon and water. This acid rinse will help to restore a smooth 
      cuticle and shine to your hair.
<li>Healthy hair: Regular protein shampoos are fine. Blondes might 
      try a chamomile shampoo, which has mild bleaching properties. 
      Brunettes might use a henna shampoo, which has mild reddening 
      properties.
<li>Oily hair: Use a lemon based shampoo.
<li>All types: Jojoba based shampoo is successful in treating scalp 
      conditions as well as dissolving sebum buildup. It leaves your 
      hair clean and shining. 
</ul>
<p>For all types of hair, try alternating shampoos. Use one type once 
      or twice a week and the other once or twice a week. Change brands 
      every few months to keep your hair shiny and full of life. Diet 
      plays an important role in hair care also, so pay attention to 
      what you eat and try to incorporate a healthy balance of foods.

<p>As for the comment made by your hairdresser, who knows what she 
      was referring to? She may have thought that your hair lacked some 
      of its natural oils which can come with washing every day if you 
      don't have oily hair. Next time you go for a haircut, ask your 
      hairdresser's opinion of how often she thinks you should wash your 
      hair based on its condition, and what types of shampoo she 
      recommends. Another opinion can't hurt...

Hair removal
</h3>
<br>
Dear Alice,

<p>What exactly does a depilatory do? How does it work? Does hair 
      grow back thicker and faster than before, like with shaving? For 
      that matter, if you trim hair with a pair of scissors, does that 
      also make it grow back thicker and faster? How about plucking with 
      tweezers?

<p>-Hairy and Curious

<hr>

Dear Hairy and Curious,

<p>Depilatories cause hair to disintegrate while leaving the roots 
      intact. Depilatories thus permit hair regrowth. By disintegrating 
      chemical bonds in the hair shaft, a depilatory turns your hair 
      into a gelatinous mass, which is then wiped away. Because these 
      agents dissolve protein, they also affect the skin and can 
      irritate if left on too long. Two types of depilatories are 
      available-- the sulfide types are more effective, but their odor 
      is pungent and they are more irritating. The thioglycolate types 
      must be left on longer, but they are more easily perfumed and are 
      not so irritating. There are also wax depilatories, which are 
      comparable to widespread tweezing. Warm wax is placed on the skin, 
      allowed to dry, and then peeled off with the hairs attached. 

<p>Shaving is a quick, easy and effective method of hair removal, and 
      it is not true that it causes hair to grow back more abundantly or 
      rapidly. However, it does leave the cut shaft of hair in place, as 
      does trimming with a pair of scissors, so regrowth is inevitable. 
      Tweezing can be painful, but is effective in hair removal. Each 
      pluck starts another growing cycle in the hair root, so this is 
      not a permanent method either. 

<p>Electrolysis is the only permanent method of hair removal. With 
      this procedure, the hair bulb is destroyed by an electric current 
      so that hair cannot regrow. However, electrolysis may be 
      complicated by temporary irritation from the procedure or later, 
      by pitlike scarring. Also, incomplete destruction may allow hair 
      to grow back. As with everything, the quality of the results 
      depends on the skill of the operator; both cost and skill vary, 
      but not necessarily in tandem.
